James W. Jesso is an author, podcaster, and public speaker focusing on topics related to psychedelic culture, medicine, and research.

His two full-length books, Decomposing The Shadow: Lessons From The Psilocybin Mushroom (2013) and The True Light Of Darkness (2015) explore his groundbreaking framework for working with psilocybin mushrooms as an ally in personal and spiritual development.

Jesso also authored numerous articles and essays published in anthologies, newspapers, and online; done numerous radio, podcast, and print interviews; given lectures, workshops, and various public speaking events now span over eleven different countries; and, as an integration coach, supported hundreds of people in making sense of their psychedelic experiences, be they having been beautiful or terrifying.

His podcast Adventures Through The Mind is an effort to contribute to the psychedelic culture at large, featuring interviews with luminaries in science, art, and culture across various disciplines, always with the guiding inquiry of how we might work with and through our psychedelic experiences to become better peopleâ€”for ourselves and for all those with whom we are nested in relationship, human and non-human alike.
