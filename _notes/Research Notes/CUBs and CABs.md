### CUBS (core unconscious beliefs)

> In response to early childhood trauma, we form core unconscious beliefs (CUBs) about ourselves and the world. These beliefs create the self we believe to be our true self but isn’t. We create our life by enacting these beliefs. They were originally unpleasant or even unbearable body se-n sations that we translate into meaning about the self and the world. 
> 
> These beliefs are negative, self-destructive and self-sabotaging. But they form the interpretive filtering system through which all events, circu-m stances and conditions of our life must pass. Even though we create our reality through them, because they are unconscious we cannot own them. In this sense, they prevent us from taking responsibility for our lives.

### CABS (compensational actions and beliefs)

> Both the trauma that causes us to form these beliefs, and the beliefs themselves, are too painful for a child to integrate. Therefore, they be come unconscious and we find ways to compensate. We do this, if we are able, through compensating actions and beliefs (CABs). 
> 
> We can think about CABs as a transport system, our way of getting around in life. It’s like calling a taxi because we don’t have our own car to navigate through life. Our own car would be our spontaneous, natural and intuitive impulses — a trauma-free self. Most of us, however, were taught to be frightened of driving our own car. If we lived through ourCUsB we would get nowhere. It would be like a traffic jam 24/7. 
> 
> We would be depressed, anxious, compulsive, withdrawn, powerless, and we would lack sufficient vitality to take care of the basic necessities. This is why we need CABs to navigate our life in the presence of trauma. The problem is that once they are formed, they last a lifetime. This is our false self, showing up as very precise compensating beliefs and actions. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CCMYMVV?page=197&annotation=TT2LBY4L))
