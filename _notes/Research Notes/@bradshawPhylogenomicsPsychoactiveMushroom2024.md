>[!Abstract]
> Psychoactive mushrooms in the genus Psilocybe have immense cultural value and have been used for centuries in Mesoamerica. Despite the recent surge of interest in these mushrooms due to the psychotherapeutic potential of their natural alkaloid psilocybin, their phylogeny and taxonomy remain substantially incomplete. Moreover, the recent elucidation of the psilocybin biosynthetic gene cluster is known for only five of ~165 species of Psilocybe, four of which belong to only one of two major clades. We set out to improve the phylogeny of Psilocybe using shotgun sequencing of fungarium specimens, from which we obtained 71 metagenomes including from 23 types, and conducting phylogenomic analysis of 2,983 single-copy gene families to generate a fully supported phylogeny. Molecular clock analysis suggests the stem lineage of Psilocybe arose ~67 mya and diversified ~56 mya. We also show that psilocybin biosynthesis first arose in Psilocybe, with 4 to 5 possible horizontal transfers to other mushrooms between 40 and 9 mya. Moreover, predicted orthologs of the psilocybin biosynthetic genes revealed two distinct gene orders within the biosynthetic gene cluster that corresponds to a deep split within the genus, possibly a signature of two independent acquisitions of the cluster within Psilocybe.

## Personal Summary

> They used a varity of genetic testing across a number of psilocybin containting fungi species to attempt to date when the biosynthetic gene cluster that allows for psilocybin evolved into existence, and in what order did it do so acorss those various species/genus.

## Notes

#### The genus psilocybe is estimated to have come into existence about 67 million years ago 

> The stem age of Psilocybe was estimated at 67.61 mya—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 2)


#### Psilocybin spread from psilocybe genus spread to other fungi through HGT between 40-9 mya

It appears as though ==the biosynthetic gene cluster (the set of genes that scripts for the production of a chemical within an organism) that produces psilocybin in fungi first emerges in psilocbye approx. 67mya.== (which may have evolved within psilocybe or have being acquired through HGT from another, older, fungi, which is the case remains uncertain)  

> We also show that psilocybin biosynthesis first arose in Psilocybe, with 4 to 5 possible horizontal transfers to other mushrooms between 40 and 9 mya [million years ago]. Moreover, predicted orthologs of the psilocybin biosynthetic genes revealed two distinct gene orders within the biosynthetic gene cluster that corresponds to a deep split within the genus, possibly a signature of two independent acquisitions of the cluster within Psilocybe.—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 1)


Both Panaeous and Gymnopilus then independently acquired the psilocybin BGC from psilocybe species through HGT.  
  
Panaeous sublteatus first to acquire it at ~40 million years ago with panaeous cyanescens as being the second-oldest pan species to acquire it at ~16 million years ago.

==Paneolus acquired the psilocybin BGC from psilocybe through horizontal gene transfer, with panaeous sublateatus being first, and panaeous cyanescens second.==


> Divergence dating is consistent with the earliest possible origin of the psilocybin BGC in Psilocybe approximately ~67 mya with subsequent acquisitions by four other genera between ~40 (Panaeolus) and ~9 (Gymnopilus) mya (Fig. 3, Right and SI Appendix). The crown age of Psilocybe was estimated at ~57 mya in the phylogenomic dataset, which predates the estimated origin of psilocybin in the next possible oldest lineage, Panaeolus. However, the relative ages of the psilocybin-producing Panaeolus stem and the crown age of Psilocybe in the LSU dataset suggest the earliest possible origin could be in Panaeolus. Additionally, two species of Panaeolus and two species of Gymnopilus known to contain the psilocybin BGC were paraphyletic in the LSU phylogeny. The most parsimonious interpretation is that the psilocybin BGC was gained twice independently in each genus. The first acquisition in Panaeolus (Pa.) is in Pa. subalteatus ~40 mya with a second acquisition ~16 mya in Pa. cyanescens. The first acquisition in Gymnopilus is in G. aeruginosus ~22 mya with a second in G. junonius ~9 mya. The psilocybin BGC was gained in Pluteus ~22 mya and in Pholiotina ~11 mya—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 4)

> Panaeolus cyanescens appears to have a HGT event with the ancestor of Psilocybe cubensis/subcubensis. However, the LSU tree indicates that Pa. subalteatus is relatively older than Pa. cyanescens, and therefore the possibility remains that an earlier HGT event occurred between Panaeolus and Psilocybe.—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 5)

> HGT seems to be the most likely explanation for the polyphy­letic distribution of the psilocybin BGC.—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 5)

#### The ecological role for psilocybin remains unknown due to lacking significant data to support a conclusive hypothesis. 

> Despite its prominence in the scientific and public imagination, experimental evidence for the ecological role of psilocybin is largely lacking and speculation reigns supreme, as thoroughly investigated and reviewed in Meyer and Slot (2023) (53).—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 6)

#### Considering psilocybin ecological role with respect to mammals

One consideration is that psilocybin is meant to either deter large fauna like mammals through disorentation. This is unlikely due to the effects taking long enough after consumption to make aversion learning unlikely in mammals. Also, they are so rare and sparse in most forest ecologies that

It is possible that there is a positive role of spore distribution through vommiting or deficiation after animal consumption. This is certaintly likely in dung-loving species such as those that thrive in cow patties. Although, given that the gund-loving varieties are a later evolution of psilocybe, it is likley this is relationship emerged as part of their potential coevoltuion with animals. I.e.[[@meyerEvolutionEcologyPsilocybin2023#Coevolution and the presence of psilocybin/psiloids or other psychoactives is determined by the specific animals that fungi is targeting|Meyer's presenation of coevolution with animals]]

However, even this is unlikely as a key reason for the nautral selection of psilocybin as there are very few vertabrate animals/mammals that we have evidence for consuming psilocybin other than humans and dogs. Even with the aforementioned presence of dung-loving specicies growing on cow poo, this has little to do with psilocybin itself and more to do with the fact that the fungi have developed a symboitic relationship with the cows eating the grass that both contains spores and the fungi itself feed off of. Wherein the combonation of these things means that the fungi can myceliate and propogate in the mascated grass the cows poop out (perhaps even in one or all of their stomach compartments).


> However, in humans, the onset of symptoms is delayed by 30 min or more, effectively decoupling the effects from their source. Because of the potentially large effect of psilocybin on GI processes through interactions with serotonin receptors in the gut, it is also possible that psilocybin functions as an emetic or laxative to promote the dispersal of spores before they are rendered inviable by digestion. In fact, nausea is commonly reported in human clinical trials (62). However, other than humans, there are few documented cases of vertebrates consuming psilocybincontaining mushrooms (consisting entirely of domesticated dogs) (63). Many Psilocybe mushrooms are uncommon or scarce, and it is difficult to imagine how animals could learn to recognize them with infrequent encounters and delayed pharmacological activity, limiting the selective potential of psilocybin as a psychoactive defense.—(Bradshaw et al., 2024, p. 6)
