## Personal Summary

Using research with adolescents, they test their hypothesis that wise reasoning is increased by a) experiences of awe through awe's self-transcendent effects on one's sense of self—smaller self—and sense of connection—encountering  and feel connected to something larger than ourselves—creating the conditions for wise perspectives, and b) the need for relatedness triggering application of those awe-induced wise perspectives to be applied in social conflict situations.

This hypothesis was validated.

## NOTES

##### Awe create self-transcendence in two ways, which create the conditions for wise reasoning

The proposition is that awe creates a state of self-transcendence (and by this I assume they mean the established boundaries of the self that are forced into accommodation during the awe state) and it is in the change in the self-construal from that self-transcendence triggered awe experience, namely the small-self and expanded lines of connection, that create the conditions for wise reasoning.

##### Wise Reasoning as an aspect of Wisdom

They are outlining wise reasoning as a specific capacity or aspect of wisdom and then applying it to conflict problem solving, not defining wisdom as conflict problem solving reasoning.

> In conflict problem-solving, wisdom can be conceptualized as a set of reasoning strategies—referred to as wise reasoning—that are useful in resolving a large number of social conflicts.Wise reasoning is highly applicable to interpersonal conflicts and addresses complex and ill-defined interpersonal problems [3], prompting individuals to examine various types of social relationships and make practical behavioral decisions.—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

Wisdom enables wise reasoning on conflicts, but this itself is not a defining character of wisdom according to other papers I have read thus far. 

One might interpret the definition characteristic of wisdom being related to "a good life" as including managing conflicting interests towards a common good. 

But that would be a potential subset and not necessarily universal amongst wisdom itself.

> Wisdom enables people to skillfully and strategically balance multiple conflicting interests to achieve a common good [—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

  
##### Various aspects of wise reasoning 

Various aspects of wise reasoning (something that is not necessarily wisdom itself) and their underlying requirement of the decentralization of oneself (e.g. ego-decentering, or transcendence)

> Wise reasoning consists of the following four main aspects: (a) intellectual humility or recognition of one’s own limitations, (b) considering and adopting a broader perspective than the present, (c) recognizing uncertainty and change, and (d) compromising or integrating dissent [3]. Researchers have argued that the common feature of different aspects of wise reasoning is that it requires people to transcend the limitations of self-centeredness [8,9].—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

##### Excessive self-attention creates cognitive biases and hampers ability to correctly perceive situations.

This is also connected to [[@grossmannWisdomContext2017#First-Person (hot) and Third-Person (cold) perspectives with respect to wisdom]]

> In specific analysis, excessive attention to the self often limits one’s perspective and brings some cognitive biases, such as self serving bias in attribution situations and optimism bias in prediction situations.—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

  
....  

##### Solomon's paradox and self-transcendence

Solomon's paradox is being able to offer wisdom to others, but unable to offer it onto oneself. A kind of of blindness to self-applicable wisdom. Having the cognitive capacity or platform to consider personal situations beyond one's first-person perspective can help prevent this. That capacity/platform is assisted by experiences of self-transcendence.

> Moreover, empirical research has shown that virtues with self-transcendence enhance wise reasoning and eliminate Solomon’s paradox of wisdom—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

##### How the qualities of awe are connected with wisdom

The transcendent nature of awe, its cultivation of humility, triggering of accommodation, the decreased need for cognitive closure (increased tolerance for uncertainty), and cultivation of a smaller self all leans well to the deprioritization of first-person perspectives and cultivating of 3rd person perspectives, [[@grossmannWisdomContext2017#First-Person (hot) and Third-Person (cold) perspectives with respect to wisdom|which are an aspect of wise.]]

> As an emotion of self-transcendence, awe refers to the complex emotional experience of wonder in the face of something vaster, greater, and beyond current comprehension [12]. Empirical research based on both self-report and behavioral performance showed that awe made individuals humbler [13] and reduced anxiety in the process of waiting for uncertain information, thereby improving uncertainty tolerance [14]. Additionally, as a core characteristic of awe, the need for accommodation emphasizes changing or reconfiguring existing cognitive structures or schemas that increase openness to new experiences, which may help people adopt a broader existential approach of life [15]. Thus, awe would evidently be a facilitator of wise reasoning.—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

  
.... 
##### A presentation of the two sub-components of self-transcendence, and how awe is associated with wise reasoning.   
  
- annhilational: is the reduction of self or first-person perspective as being predominant in one's salience landscape, and the reduction of the negative aspect associated with "excessive self-focus"  
- Relational: is the component of wherein we develop an increased sense of connectedness to an expanded perception recognition of relationship... to something larger than ourselves in which we are nested.  
  
The proposition is that these two components of self-transcendence of awe produces greater capacity for wise reasoning through "inward self-weakening" and "outward expansion of connection"

> Analyzing the self-transcendence of awe, self-transcendence includes two broad complementary subcomponents: (a) an “annhilational” component, which refers to the reduced self-salience that decreases the negative aspects of excessive self-focus; and (b) a “relational” component, which refers to the sense of connectedness and extensive perception of relatedness [16]. Accordingly, we proposed two influence paths of awe: “inward self-weakening” and “outward expansion of connection.”—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)


With respect to "inward self-weakening" what they are referring to is the cultivation of the smaller self, the humbleness awe triggers in us and the resulting impact of how "large" we perceive ourselves to be in the grand scheme of things.

> Therefore, we hypothesized that awe would be positively associated with wise reasoning via small-self—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 2)

  With respect to "outward expansion of connection" what they are referring to is the experince of that smaller self coupled with the recognition what what it is smaller to is also what they are a part of. The consequence being that their smaller sense of self is not intertwined with the a larger sense of connection to something beyond themselves.

> awe expands awareness, making individuals more open and flexible to environmental stimuli, reducing boundaries and increasing relatedness in a broad sense [—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 3)

  

##### Self-determination theory-people's need for relatedness

Self-determination theory suggest that individuals have a need for relatedness, which is expressed in the desire to feel connected in social networks of mutual care and within a network of satisfying and coherent socialization. Also, that when this need is met, individuals generally are more accepting, understanding, and likely to embrace others around them.

> According to self-determination theory, the need for relatedness refers to the individual’s desire to remain connected to others, care for each other, obtaining support, and more generally feeling a satisfying and coherent communion with the socialized world [21]. The theory asserts that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs is the key to healthy growth and development of individuals. When the need for relatedness is satisfied, there will be more energy to understand, accept, and embrace people and things around them—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 3)

##### Wise reasoning in social conflict being developed through need for relatedness triggering the application of awe-induced self-transcendent perspectives 

Wise reasoning would be more accessible though the changes triggered by the self-transcendence consequences of awe, and then applied into social circumstances as a part of one satisfying their need to relatedness through the application of wise reasoning into social conflict problem-solving (as such reasoning more efficiently achieved effective resolutions to those problems)

> Therefore, we hypothesized that awe would be positively associated with wise reasoning via need for relatedness—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 3)

##### A quote outlining awe's effect on self-construal and perceptions of social conflict situations

> As a self-transcendent emotion, awe can transcend the limitations of egocentricity and transform the “I” of the experiential perspective to the “me” of the observer’s perspective [33], enabling individuals to view conflict from the spectator’s point of view, recognize their own limitations, and be more objective and rational, thus enhancing wise reasoning in conflict situations.—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 5)


##### Hypothesis validated

> the hypothesis that awe facilitates wise reasoning through the mediating role of small-self and need for relatedness was validated—(Wu et al., 2023, p. 7)
