## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This was a very brief, almost comically brief, explanation that the heart encodes and processes memories in connection with the brain. 
> 
> This was discovered through heart transplantation wherein the recepinent would show personality traits similar to that of the donor after transplant, that were not present before. They propose this as being related to a kind of cellular memory carried in the intracariac nervous system (the heart's brain) and transfered to the recepient.
>  
> A very interesting aspect of this, was their presentation of "emotional thoughts" that were carried by the heart and translated to feelings in the donor. 



>[!Abstract]
> This chapter encounters the question, “is the heart related to the memory or not”. According to heart transplantation studies, there are multiple changes in the personality of the receiver that favors the traits of the donor. In addition to that the chapter tackles a comparison between the common definition of the memory and the cellularCellular memory, in which both have the ability of encoding, storage, and retrieval. 
> 
> In addition to that the exosomes (proteins) play a role in information transfer between the organs and body cells, adding to our understanding of different shapes of memories within the human body. Neuroplasticity, on the other hand, plays a major role in the memory as well. It has shown that heart transplantationHeart transplantation recipients have showed the ability to retrieve information believed to be stored in the intra-cardiac nervous system. 
> 
> Moreover, the neurotransmitters play a key role in the process as they represent the main medium for information transfer between the neurons. Heart memoryHeart memory evidences are rising in number as the medicine is taking new approaches toward technology and research. It was proven that multiple forms of memory were found on cellular and neurological levels. Evidences are derived from heart transplantationHeart transplantation studies and molecularMolecular sciences, in which all points to the theory of “multiple forms of memory”.

## Notes

#### Some emotions are literally sourced in the heart

There as such a thing as "heart feelings" that are processes by the brain as emotions.


> Emotions which are controlled by the brain have some sources in the heart so we call it heart feelings. —(Hashim et al., 2022, p. 306)


#### Heart Feelings can be transferred from Donor to Recipient

When a heart is transplanted, feelings from the donor heart can be transferred to the recipient in ways that express as changed in personality that align with the donor but weren't present in the recipient before.


> These feelings can be transferred with the heart to the new recipients that can act like the donor—(Hashim et al., 2022, p. 306)
....  
> when the transplanted heart is being implanted into the new recipient, it will keep its programming for the previous body. This does not cancel the effects of the recipient’s brain and immune system.—(Hashim et al., 2022, p. 307)

  
....  

#### These feelings may be stored in the cells of the heart, cellular memory

The suggestion is that these feelings/memories are store directly in the heart cells, and once transplanted translated into through and feelings in the recipient.

> Some emotional thoughts in the heart can be kept in the heart cells and the heart being transferred, it will transfer these feelings to the new person that can affect his original thoughts and feelings—(Hashim et al., 2022, p. 307)

  
....  

#### The storage of these feeling-memories may be related to DNA, RNA, and proteins 

They also suggest that these cellular storage of feeling memories may be related to the unique sequence the heart's "cardiomyocytes" (cardiac muscle cells) caused by the RNA, DNA, and protein profile of the donor. Those sequences are then carried over to the recipient

> RNA and DNA composition and proteins alternation in the cardiomyocytes have their special sequences that may differ from human to human. So, after transplantation, they keep their own sequences that will keep the same function for the transplanted heart so when the heart has a memory of feeling, these feelings will be kept and transferred to the recipients where they will be expressed again—(Hashim et al., 2022, p. 307)
