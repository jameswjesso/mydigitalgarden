## Personal Summary

>[!...]
>Outlining the effect microdosing has on emodiversity. Results suggest that, overall, it actually reduced emodiveristy with some notable increases in the amplitude of certain emotions both positive and negative.

## Notes


#### Emodiversity as a term similar to biodiversity but in reference to one's emotional landscape


> Mirroring biodiversity, emodiversity has been conceptualized as “the richness (how many specific emotions are experienced) and evenness (the extent to which specific emotions are experienced in the same proportion) in the human emotional ecosystem—(Pop and Dinkelacker, 2023, p. 2)

  
....  

#### Emodiveristy was not increased on microdosing days, but decreased

> First, in line with recent arguments in the literature stating that engaging in the microdosing practice could increase emotional awareness, we expected to find that during days when a microdose was ingested as well as with more cumulative instances of microdosing the level of emodiversity across both positive and negative emotions, and subsequently also overall emodiversity, to be higher. Still, this was not the case.  
> 
> Surprisingly, during a microdosing day, and when the average level of positive and negative affect was accounted for, we found that levels of positive emodiversity as well as overall emodiversity were lower—(Pop and Dinkelacker, 2023, p. 5)

  
....  

#### Certain emotions (positive and negative) increased, others decreased

Certain positive emotions like absorption and awe, and negative emotions like disgust and shame raised, but common positive lowered…. Reason?

> among the positive valence emotions, during microdosing days the proportion represented by “awe, wonder, or amazement” was significantly higher while the proportion of “joyful, glad, or happy” was significantly lower. Similarly, among the negative valence emotions, during microdosing days the proportion represented by “ashamed, humiliated, or disgraced” was significantly higher.  
> 
> That “awe, wonder, or amazement” was found to take a more prominent place during microdosing days among positive emotions is in line with results from a recent experimental study (van Elk et al., 2021). However, the results regarding the decrease prevalence of “joyful, glad, or happy” among the positive emotions and the increased prevalence of “ashamed, humiliated, or disgraced” among negative emotions, are surprising—(Pop and Dinkelacker, 2023, p. 5)

>[!warning] They did not track different psychedelics seperately in this study
> Not tracking which psychedelics were being microdosed here is disappointing, and I think this muddies the results. I see this kind of thing in microdosing studies (and other studies on psychedelics), essentially that LSD and psilocybin are basically the same or something. The ignorance of (supposed) objective distance in the science, I guess.
