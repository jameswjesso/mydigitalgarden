### The 4 areas that psychedelics seem to work that may contribute to their efficacy in treating brain injury

- Neuroinflammation
- Hippocampus neurogenesis
- Neuroplasticity
- Increase in brain complexity



##### Neruoinflammation

Psychedelics represent a novel form of anti-inflammatory, different than the other 3 we presently have.

>“There are currently three main classes of anti-inflammatory drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids such as prednisone, and biologics which act like sponges to “soak up” inflammatory cytokines (1). Psychedelics may represent a fourth class of anti-inflammatory drug” ([Khan et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/EXB2VQNW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W9NQ7L5F?page=2&annotation=VMKFR48Z))


What is novel about it is that their anti inflammatory effects seem to directly but selectively target the inflammation associated with pathological immune responses to injury

> “In other words, psychedelics may target many of the pathologic immune responses without exposing the body to the risks of total immune suppression (e.g., serious infection) or potential side effects of existing biologics (e.g., malignancy and cardiovascular disease).” ([Khan et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/EXB2VQNW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W9NQ7L5F?page=2&annotation=UUDKG54W))


It appears there is some substantial evidence to support DMT as a significant anti neuroinflammatory agent. As does MDMA.


5-MeO-DMT as well

> “Dakic et al. (22)were the first to document that a closely related congener of DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, found in high concentrations of the toxin of Incilius alvarius (Colorado River Toad), favorably altered the cerebral proteome with regard to factors involved with plasticity and neuroprotection including long-term potentiation, apoptosis, morphogenesis/maturation of dendritic spines, and T-lymphocyte differentiation, while inhibiting factors involved in neurodegeneration and cell death.” ([Khan et al., 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/EXB2VQNW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W9NQ7L5F?page=3&annotation=5J6XVA5A))


#### Neuroplasticity

More neuroplasticity with lower doses than higher ones with psilocybin (although a later comment suggested that higher can produce same levels if taken once weekly)

> “Acute administration of psilocybin to mice alters hippocampal neurogenesis in a non-linear fashion (35). Low doses lead to increased neurogenesis while higher doses inhibit it.” ([Khan et al., 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/EXB2VQNW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W9NQ7L5F?page=3&annotation=9CRBUN7V))


It is perhaps the neuroplasticity effects of psychedelics that lead to their efficacy in treat a broad range of psychiatric conditions. 

> “The persistent symptom improvement in psychiatric disorders with administration of psychedelics has been proposed to be driven by this neuroplastic adaptation (2).” ([Khan et al., 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/EXB2VQNW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W9NQ7L5F?page=3&annotation=5SXAVLMT))


#### OTHER

Psilocybin mushrooms are more potent than psilocybin alone, suggesting a kind of entourage effects might be happening with the whole food form.

> “Of note, an “entourage” effect has been demonstrated with psychedelic mushrooms in which whole mushroom extracts are on the order of 10 times more potent than purified psilocin administered alone in neurobehavioral rat models (72).” ([Khan et al., 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/EXB2VQNW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W9NQ7L5F?page=4&annotation=IZ7VHHTZ))
