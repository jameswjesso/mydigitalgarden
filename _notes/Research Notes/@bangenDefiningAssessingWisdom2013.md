## Notes

##### The result of overlapping sub components of wisdom out of empirical research.  

> The most commonly included subcomponents, which appeared in more than half of the definitions are (1) social decision making and pragmatic knowledge of life, which relates to social reasoning, ability to give good advice, life knowledge, and life skills; (2) prosocial attitudes and behaviors, which include empathy, compassion, warmth, altruism, and a sense of fairness; (3) reflection and self-understanding, which relates to introspection, insight, intuition, and self-knowledge and awareness; (4) acknowledgement of and coping effectively with uncertainty; and (5) emotional homeostasis, which relates to affect regulation and self-control. Finally, subcomponents included in fewer than half of the reviewed definitions include (1) value relativism and tolerance, which involves a nonjudgmental stance and acceptance of other value systems; (2) openness to new experience; (3) spirituality; and (4) sense of humor.—([Bangen et al., 2013, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/B39NLN65)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZD7LDMSN?page=3&annotation=HHGP5FUJ))


#### The multi-dimensional nature of wisdom is greater than the sum of its parts. 

> Although there is still no consensus definition of wisdom, there has been recent progress as evidenced by the significant overlap among empirical definitions as well as the recent expert panel conducted by Jeste and colleagues (29). Notably, most theorists believe that wisdom is multi- dimensional (5, 7, 12, 23, 29, 36, 37)—([Bangen et al., 2013, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/B39NLN65)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZD7LDMSN?page=5&annotation=3VIBMQJ7))

> Wisdom is thought to be a complex, multidimensional characteristic with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. An individual should holistically integrate several or all subcomponents of wisdom to a high degree in order to be wise—([Bangen et al., 2013, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/B39NLN65)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZD7LDMSN?page=6&annotation=VR362APC))

....  
#### Wisdom as serving the common good

> A subcomponent of wisdom that was cited by nearly all definitions relates to prosocial values and behavior, suggesting that wisdom is a useful construct and serves a common good—([Bangen et al., 2013, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/B39NLN65)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZD7LDMSN?page=6&annotation=NJCNGVM3))

#### Wisdom therapy cultivates wisdom perspectives 

Wisdom therapy cultivates wisdom through supporting people to take on multiple perspectives on life events with the explicit goal of enhancing one's capacity for cognitive flexibility and wise thinking 

> To our knowledge, only one psychotherapy technique has explicitly targeted increased wisdom as a therapy goal. So called wisdom therapy uses modified versions of the Berlin Wisdom Project’s research protocol to facilitate the client’s abilities to consider challenging life events from multiple perspectives with the aim of enhancing subcomponents of wisdom including flexible thinking and acceptance of uncertainty—([Bangen et al., 2013, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/B39NLN65)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZD7LDMSN?page=7&annotation=BNF6D7WG))
