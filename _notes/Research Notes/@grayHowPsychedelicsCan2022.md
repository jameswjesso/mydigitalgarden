##### We either experience love, or it's absence... Gabor Mate quote.

> The renowned Hungarian Canadian physician Gabor Maté says that we either experience love, or we experience what’s in the way of it. Psychedelics allow us to experience love, that most renewable of resources. When I feel its full force, I am overpowered and break down in tears. That this happens again and again, throughout my decades here on Earth, is a miracle.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=12&annotation=CBXE7Y8F))

....  
##### Becoming comfortable in being closed off to each other, hardened and rigid in the beliefs that support it

*Depending on life circumstances, we can learn to become comfortable in our openness or our closed-ness to each other. We can become hardened into that closed-ness, and rigid over time, stuck in how and what we believe as a consequence of the experiences that led us to close and harden. This is a place of rut and eventually isolation (from other beliefs that challenge the rigid one needed to maintain the closed position's supremacy over opening). It is in here that mental health issue can arise.*

> We learn to be comfortable in an open or a closed position, depending on our life lessons and traumas. Some of us along the way hardened as we grew up. Every wound leaves a scar; every scar tells a story; every story yields a belief. Within that belief lies a limitation. As soon as we’re sure of one thing, we’ve shut ourself off from a thousand other explanations. Stuck in our ways, in our beliefs, in our limitations, we grow inflexible; our circle narrows and closes down. We are not open to new people, new experiences, or new perspectives. When we’re caught in our ruts, in our rigid beliefs, in our small social circles, we are closed off to other ways of being in the world. In the psychiatric world, we see addictions, obsessions, compulsions, and delusions all coming down to this issue of cognitive rigidity.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=13&annotation=HUGQX8VH))

....  
##### Mystical explorers, prophecy, and the end of flatland days 

*Great quote.*

> Mystics, explorers of deep psychonautic realms, intuitives, the longheld prophecies of multiple Indigenous/traditional tribes and societies around the planet, and the clearly evident and observable developments of increasingly rapid climate change, madcap materialism, and gross economic and social inequality and imbalance all point to an inescapable truth: the longstanding dominant mindset of spiritual disconnect that has cast its shadow over the human enterprise has run its course and is no longer viable or sustainable. The flatland days of continuing as we have been are all but over.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=19&annotation=WFLZ99IY))

....  

> Let’s be clear from the outset that none of the contributors to this book are naïve, picturing or promising a golden age of peace and harmony around the next bend. All of us understand that we are moving into an extremely difficult period that may last decades or longer, and that the successful fruition of this period of Great Transition is far from certain.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=21&annotation=MMXEJAFF))

....  
##### Small shifts in a system as a crisis point creates significant change

*The growing instability of the system of humanity and in a sense life on earth as a consequence will not only force us into an eventually crisis decision point, but due to the intactly of the system, the system itself will be extremely sensitive to the influence of that that decision./ For better or worse (Bache believes for better)*

> When a system goes sufficiently into the far-from-equilibrium state, it comes to a fork in its destiny known as a bifurcation point. At this point a flux occurs in which many possible futures exist. Chaos theory tells us that at this critical juncture, systems become extremely sensitive to influence. Small changes can be disproportionately amplified by the hypersensitivity of the system. The severity of the global systems crisis, therefore, may be lowering the threshold of influence and amplifying the impact that individuals can have on shaping the outcome of this crisis.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, pp. 14-15](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=33&annotation=UYDW5E8E))

....  
##### Duane Elgin on how stories shape our world and the new stories we need to navigate present collapse

*The premise here is that the story which which we understand and thus experiences ourselves plays a significant role in the choices we make within and thus the results of those choices on our lives, individually and collectively. Elgin presents that there are other stories we could be telling now, in our times of crisis that are accurate and factual, but "serve the well-being of all life".  

Those are: HUMANITY IS GROWING UP; THE GLOBAL BRAIN IS WAKING UP; THE PLANET IS GIVING BIRTH;THE SACRED FEMININE IS REEMERGING*

##### Definition: Amor Fati

*QUOTE: Definition of Amor Fait  
Cite: Jacques Verduin GRIP materials for prisoners, quoted in Choosing Earth (2020), 15.*

> Amor means love. Fati means fate. Amor fati is a Latin expression that means loving your fate, including suffering and loss. The key to achieving Amor Fati is an attitude of deep acceptance of the events that take place in your life. It is the practice of embracing what happens, particularly the painful things.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=70&annotation=X2X2XSM2))

##### Definition: Fiat Lux "Let There Be Light"

> Fiat Lux. “Let there be light.”—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=87&annotation=ET3FCPEJ))

....  
##### The obstacle is the way.  

This links to Jenkinson's suggestion that we must sit in our poverty first and then through that grief something will emerge. There is no other way for it to as any other way will simply be more poverty.  

It also links to the journey of psychedelics and shadow work. The challenges we face are the way, not what blocks us from the way.*

> Because what we want, what we cosmic orphans often yearn for, is a return to the womb, where we’re loved, safe, and secure, and everything is going to work out. But the obstacle, as the famous Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius reminds us, is the way.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=87&annotation=YGWZ937H))

....  
##### Mother earth continues to share her beauty with us even as we harm her, and this same beauty and resilience is in us too..  

> DESPITE THE GREAT ATTACK and terrors inflicted on Mother Earth, she continues to show her beauty and generosity. In her infinite resilience, she draws from deep within herself the fresh water that comforts and quenches our thirst, the fruits that satisfy our hunger, and the forests that welcome our spirit and reconnect us to the universe and the stars. This beauty, this generosity, and this same resilience is also within us. Yes. Because we are her children. We are born from within her; we are part of her manifestation of life.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=92&annotation=9MW528MD))

....  
##### We all hold an ancestral memory within us. That memory is of our connection to life and earth. 

Even if we have never known it, we can still remember it enough to be changed by it.  

And in that, forgetting is normal, individually and  collectively over time. We need this forgetting as the pain that come from it is forwards us to knowledge and claiming ourselves as beings alive on this planet*

> Within all of us there is this memory. Ancestral memory. It reconnects the thread of life; it can heal the pain of separation. What memory is this? Where is it? It is within us, in our suffocated scream, in our abandoned childhood. It’s in the deep waters of our being where the cry of our pain lives, where the memory of our ancestry also lives. Hear the voice of the heart. It speaks to us, directs us to discover that we are not alone, that we are part of a whole, that we belong to a larger organism to which our life is directly linked, that feeds us, that quenches our thirst, that comforts us, that introduces us to beauty and harmony. We often forget. Forgetting is part of the plunge into the dark that will clear up with the awakening of consciousness—the mysteries of Mother Earth. We came from the light, we were born from love, but we need to know pain and forgetfulness to reach knowledge, and to choose to be what we came here to be. It is like the seed, which was born from the flower, from the fruit, from the sunlight. It must dive into the dark of Mother Earth, know the—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=96&annotation=X73IWFW2))

....  

> Neuroscientists say the number of connections that can be made between the one hundred billion neurons in the human brain exceeds the number of atoms in the universe. And we know that while we all live by patterns that correlate to neuronal channels in the brain, we make new channels, perhaps many of hundreds of them, when we consume psychedelics.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=101&annotation=HV9YXZ3I))

....  
##### When entering ceremony, make it clear (make the declaration) that benevolent sprits that have our best interests at heart are welcome, and others are not.

> Hamilton Souther, founder of Blue Morpho. “Only let in the spirits that are kind, wise, and have your best interests at heart,” he told me. Every ceremony I make the declaration that any entity that is kind and wise and has my best interests at heart can come close, and all others must stay away.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=101&annotation=F3LR9Z77))

....  
##### I can experince psychedelics as a battle of hardships, or a temple of spirit, 

and depending on how I care for my body, specifically with respect to it being a temple (and Yoga being a way of maintaining that), I will be more or less able to choose temple.

> The maloca can be my MMA octagon with blood and pain and broken bones. Or it can be my temple, with the sweet and loving touch of spirit everywhere, wafting floral incense, flickering candles. I choose the temple.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=103&annotation=XLG5DK62))

....  
##### Through ceremony we learn to resonate our bodies, gross and subtle, to the energy of the divine, which we can then carry out into the world as ourselves, unique as us.

> I realized that during Santo Daime “works” (ritual ceremonies), we are given the opportunity to repeatedly dive into a vortex of high-level, inherently sacred, and deeply transformative energies. We are given the grace of having structured times and spaces in which we can slowly, organically, learn how to resonate, in our cells, in our subtle bodies, with these vibratory frequencies of divinity. And then, with the grace of God and the Divine Mother, we can carry these energies out into the world, offering them in and through our own precious, unique individuality to the world in which we live—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=117&annotation=KPKJSW59))

....  
##### What is Divination? ... This whole section is just gorgeous.

> What is divinization?—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=119&annotation=XJE3UJXW))

....  
##### There is always more. There is no end. Love is infinite and to feel that is "the greatest gift we can possibly receive"

> And, miraculously, there’s no end to divinization. There’s no final moment of enlightenment when we stop growing; when we stop learning. There’s always more. There’s always more. And that more is ever new. Ever deepening. Ceaselessly creative and fecund. Always surprising. Love is infinite, and to feel that love, more and more fully, is itself the greatest gift we can possibly receive.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, pp. 106-107](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=124&annotation=Z32ZCL6C))

....  
##### The fundamental impoverishment of the Naturalism worldview  

(Natrualism: the natural—aka only real—world consists only of what is external and can be measured by science.)*

> It’s here where I come up against some unexamined assumptions in the naturist’s conceptualization of “reality” that highlight the fundamental impoverishment of this worldview. Naturism posits that the natural world consists only of what is external, what can be measured by science. In doing so, it dismisses entire realms of experience that are internal, that cannot (at least at the present time) be measured by any scientific instrumentation available to us, but that nonetheless are “real” in the sense that we experience them.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 111](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=129&annotation=HGM7J75N))

....  
##### The Primacy Of Experience ...  

Anything that we can experience is real. That we experienced it makes it real.  
Although, real does not necessarily mean existing independent of our mind's experince.  

Or, as Gallimore points out in Reality Switch Technologies, real does not necessarily mean an adaptive assessment of external reality.*

> the primacy of experience. I posit that anything that we can experience is real. We know that it is real, because we experience it. That alone establishes it as real, and one could go a step further and assert that anything that is beyond the scope of experience, that cannot be experienced, may or may not be “real”—but we have no way of knowing because it is beyond experience.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 111](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=129&annotation=H2TH7SQ2))

--- Dennis McKenna

....  

> If the goal of science is to understand and explicate reality, then it must expand the scope of its quest to include phenomena that are internally experienced—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 112](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=130&annotation=XC3YIU3A))

##### the wonder that is being alive in this complex world of life as we known it in the context of the infiniteness of potentiality that exists in reality and the universe

*A beautiful quote about reflecting on the wonder that is being alive in this complex world of life as we known it in the context of the infiniteness of potentiality that exists in reality and the universe.*

> In fact, there is no end; there is only the journey. And as we contemplate this fundamental insight, in our search for the miraculous we should take a moment to reflect: how, in the fullness of evolutionary time, on a backwater planet in some lesser arm of the galactic spiral, did it come to pass that organisms with big brains and complex nervous systems emerged that are capable of contemplating the infinitude of nature and our place within it? And not only that, but that the neurotransmitters that fire within our brains to create the warp and weft of consciousness resemble, and in many cases, are identical to the small molecules that mediate chemical communication networks across the biosphere? When these molecules find their way into our synapses from whatever plant or fungal sources, they can evoke worlds of wonder and unimagined vistas of the terra incognita of the mind. Is not that fact alone a miracle, and evidence of an intelligent universe awakening unto itself?—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 115](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=133&annotation=DA7BJ6WP))

....  
##### plants are people in another dimension of reality

> For the Barasana, their most profound philosophical intuition is the idea that plants and animals are but people in another dimension of reality. Wade Davis—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=139&annotation=IRBDUJGC))

....  
##### The shamans are like nuclear engineers reprogramming the/our world(s).

> For the Barasana, the role of the shaman is neither that of a physician nor a priest. He’s more like a nuclear engineer, as the social and cultural anthropologist Stephen Hugh-Jones has written, who periodically enters the heart of the reactor to reprogram the world.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 133](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=151&annotation=B9MBIE2L))

....  
##### Some good beginner advice for exploring and Journeying psychedelics from Wade Davis

in his chapter in How Psychedelics Can Save The World, "The Psychedelic Journey"*

> Those who do elect to experiment should always keep in mind what Andy Weil noted so many years ago—take them in natural forms, with a good set and setting, enveloped in your own protective cloak of ritual, whatever that means in your life.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 135](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=153&annotation=F8RIB5DC))

##### Quote about economy vs ecology

> Anyone who suggests that economy is more important than ecology should try counting their money with a plastic bag over their head.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=157&annotation=YGZABJRI))

....  
##### Cannabis: using ritual act to reduce the getting addicted to the beauty of the good-feeling medicine

The beauty and wonder of cannabis as a medicine for good-feeling (and how a ceremonial act of respect before imbibing can help us from falling into becoming addicted to that good feeling.)

> Cannabis is a nurturing mother plant that excels at helping us feel held and happy, exactly where we are—a feel-good sensation that can be addictive. I believe the distinction between medicine and poison lies in the ceremony preceding each sit with cannabis.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 142](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=160&annotation=KBCJXEMQ))

....  
##### The uselessness of addressing the symptoms of collapse without addressing the cause

> We apply ointment to the rash when we need to be treating chronic candida in the gut and the blood and in every inch of our flesh. We self-actualize and amplify and organize to change culture while our physical reality crashes around us.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 148](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=166&annotation=CF73R3BM))

....  
##### A vision of a sustainable and scalable organization system between people on the planet, as delineated by bioregion

> True hope would reflect a pattern of emergence—people flocking and schooling in breathtaking dances moving in the direction of living within their bioregion as part of that sentient system. This means building family relationships that balance autonomy and collectivity and are scaled to neighborhoods, then to communities, and then to regional identities, economies, and systems of government. Solid communities in those places would then be networked and interdependent with all the other bioregions, exchanging energy, matter, and information in dynamic relationality. This then scales to states and continents and beyond. The structures are already in place, but the flows of power are all being directed downward, and the flows of value are being sucked upward, when these flows need to be reversed.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 149](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=167&annotation=Z76G9623))

....  
##### Open Loops Vs. Closed Loops 

> Every complex system has to dump entropy, but the only way to make that sustainable is for your entropy to become another system’s lunch, recycling in closed loops with other systems. You could imagine that in very simple terms. If you’re a complex system, you have to make “poop.” And that poop goes into the system of the ground, and the plants eat it and grow and give you fruit, and that cycle continues.\*—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 150](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=168&annotation=XMXBPJCI))

....  
##### Surviving this apocalypse is possible, but requires change

We can survive this apocalypse, as we have many before us. It, however, will require change. And change is not an end to a system; "systems only end when they cease changing"

> This is not the first apocalypse we’ve experienced. In Australia there are many stories about previous cataclysms, and a lot of them are supported by the geological data. They’re quite survivable, so if people are looking for hope, that’s a good place to start. It just means we have to change a bit. I don’t know why so many cultures view change as an end. Systems only end when they cease changing.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 151](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=169&annotation=LF9VYWKN))

....  

*This was an excellent section that presents context-informed systems thinking, wherein the high context is the level of abstractions on the abstragmatics latter that recognizes the interpenetrated interconnection of all beings that recognizes all actions effect everything and everything is us, too.  
it also talks about indigenous leadership and authority systems, and optimal social organizations for flourishing together based on indigenous wisdom (e.g. dumbar number)*

> HIGH-CONTEXT CULTURES: EVERYTHING IS IN RELATION—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 151](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=169&annotation=8JBAL3PI))

....  
##### Authority vs Power in Aboriginal Australian elderhood  

Authority is earned through knowledge and Merritt, but is not something wieldable for command. The power is not in the authority, it is in the people. The authority guides, it does not decide.*

> Our elders and knowledge keepers do have authority, but they don’t have much power. There is a difference. Authority is something you earn through knowledge, and it cannot be used to command. There are no bosses. We don’t have centralized institutions because those things inevitably fall apart even if they have the best intentions. Power is distributed throughout the community.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 153](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=171&annotation=FAGDUE2K))

....  
##### Psychedelics and being stuck in the entropy loop; without a purpose for the work, there will be no work offered. 

This is something to add to DL's regard section, I reckon

> A lot of people today are tripping balls once a week, because they aren’t in right relation and are stuck in an ecstatic loop of entropy. They have no tether to a place, no kin, and no purpose for the work, so no work is delegated to them.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 155](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=173&annotation=4G7W7CXH))

##### If all it took was an ego-death, the most reckless among us would be the wisest

> Anyone can break an ego with psychedelics. With the right dose of the right synthesized chemicals, it takes less than a minute. Modern psychedelic science has become a veritable ego-dissolving, mystical experience generator. Unfortunately, if “ego death” were all that was needed for enlightenment, the most reckless among us would be the wisest. It’s easier to break shit than make shit. Building a healthy, embodied, connected, fulfilled sense of self takes a lifetime. And that building process is what San Pedro is invested in.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 163](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=181&annotation=JYA98CQG))

> In the Andes, the end of a world and a turning over to a new era is called pachacuti. Pachacuti is enormous, inevitable, and decided by earthly forces much greater than humans.

Can their insights be grounded, or are they an endless mirror of all that we long for but can- not attain?—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 168](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=186&annotation=S7PZSR7J))

##### The Endo Way

> “the Endo way.” Endo is a practice that invites altered states of consciousness delivered from endogenous (internal) sources, not requiring the use of any ingested (external) psychoactive substances.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 173](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=191&annotation=RLCV6WXW))

> To activate my own Endo machinery, I would load my mind with a key question and some fragments of design approaches, including reasoned and fanciful notions. I would then keep it in the back of my mind, holding onto the confidence that a solution would eventually be forthcoming. Sometimes stepping-stones would appear, specific actions that I knew to I had to take. After patiently waiting for weeks or months, a detailed download would come. These downloads felt like I was sitting in a movie theater as a feature film flickered to life and poured off the screen. Pencil and paper at hand, I would begin to sketch. The download would last twenty minutes to an hour and then run out of steam. I would never try to influence or embellish what was playing out by bringing in my own imagination. When in Endo, I found it best to turn off judgment and other filters and just pay attention. The Endo way has never failed me; instead it has delivered in spectacular fashion over the decades.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 173](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=191&annotation=2B2A7BNG))

##### Life is wild...

and life moves through us as it does all things and thus all things are expressions of life moving through on its way through to express as other things.

> Unlike a moral calculation or division between civilized and wild beings, I see the wild as life. The expression of life is wild. Life does not seek our species, it moves through our species. That’s why a tree was once a stone and a river was once a cloud.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 188](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=206&annotation=VKDCX3UR))

##### We are in service to life itself when we give ourselves over to feeling it as It-Self

> How can we be in service to life? Not just human life. Not just the livelihood of sentient beings. Not just the life of Earth, but life itself? It is to feel it. And not just sensation or emotion, but the feeling and awareness of the all-pervading and ever-present energy that signifies existence, consciousness, life force: to feel It-Self.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, pp. 215-216](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=233&annotation=ZQ6D7CSN))

##### One is not suck in life, it is not a cycle to escape. It is a gift to seize cherished hold of.

> I find that I do not yet resonate with the desire to end the cycle of birth and death. Life is more than a bridge between nothingness and nothingness. It is the perfect figure that dances upon that perfect, unmanifest ground. It is what is before me, and I will seize it with both hands. I am a part and product of this life, no more stuck inside of it than it is stuck inside of me.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 225](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=243&annotation=AYVG4C4Q))

##### What we call reality... 
*A quote for the modelling section of DL*

> What we call “reality” is a patchwork of our own experience, the dominant story of our times, and the experience we inherit from our ancestors. From those raw materials, we’re all constructing and reconstructing the worlds in which we live.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 235](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=253&annotation=VTA4KY7P))

##### It is not dancing we dislike, it is the feeling of discomfort and self-consciousness that dancing triggers

> in my early twenties, I hated dancing. But I quickly discovered that it wasn’t dancing that I hated. It was the feelings of discomfort and self-consciousness that overwhelmed me because I was stuck in my head.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 240](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=258&annotation=UYKLNVWK))

##### The psychedelic light show serves to distract the uninitiated. The plant's intelligence is beyond this

*The light show is a carnival meant to distract and engage the uninitiated, and the deep plat teachings emerge on the other side of being able to let that go.  
This is something to incorporate into DL regard section*

> As I follow the flight of the hummingbird through my mind, it leads me past a carnival of lights and morphing geometric patterns. I later learn that these psychedelic “parlor tricks” are meant to mesmerize unprepared initiates and stop them from proceeding further into the mystery of Talking Plants.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 246](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=264&annotation=RFTZLGZD))

##### The ancestral spirits and the talking plants and their ability to help us heal personally through helping us heal our connection to nature

*A thing to add in the end, with respect to the why any of this work matters*

> The ancestral spirits teach us that in addition to working on ourselves, we must also work to strengthen our communication with nature. Without healing our tattered relationship with the Mother, there will simply be no “us” to work on. While synthetic psychedelics can heal the mind of ailments created by civilization, the wild Talking Plants can open the door to the healing possibilities of nature. Curing the mind and body together to heal our bond with nature is our ritual of life.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 251](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=269&annotation=4WXHBJ68))

##### Cannabis spirit offers us gentle alleviation of pains; growing it embarks us on a relationship with that spirit

*An outline of her sense of what the spirit of cannabis offers. It is beautiful, although is leaves me to wonder how this kind of perspective lines up with the various less-than-desirable effects that regular cannabis use seems to have on most individuals according to modern research?*

> Cannabis spirit is a gentle guide able to alleviate our substantial pain of existence. It neither leads nor follows as it makes its circular journey from seed to plant and eventually back to seed again. Rather, it stands as an ever-evolving testament to the harmony in which we are free to indulge. Growing cannabis means to embark on a relationship with a patient entity whose development affords many opportunities to stop and take stock of our own skewed foci, maladaptive strategies, and selfish beliefs.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 255](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=273&annotation=IUEDUIW9))
