#### Chapter 1 - domestication and the dream of the planet 

We are dreaming. All of reality is a dream. Interpretations of light.

The dream is light labeled, languages, and perceived accordingly, attended to accordingly.

Our personal dream is forged of the dream of the planet --society, culture, family, history etc -- being conditioned into us throughout life. This conditioning is called domestication. 

Domestication is to be made to dream in a particular way, led by the dream of the planet  (human planet) conditioned into throughout life.

This domestication unfolds through the coercive mindset - punishment and reward, right and wrong - and we end up creating a false persona/disingenuous way of bein in order to protect of the punishment and seek the reward. 

Eventually we become our own domesticator internally, with the judge and victim in constant dynamic.

The judge judges according to the book of law. 
The book of law is the total of all the agreements that were forced to accept in childhood and beyond about who we are, how the world works, how we should be within it. And we punish ourselves for failing to meet those agreements, and/distort ourselves to do so. With the judge inside ledgering and doling out consequene.

Hell is a state of mind, created by our agreements with each other.
Our current agreements in the dream of the world is hell making

Keeping these agreements is energy intensive.
Breaking them frees energy.
we need some agreements though.
Some drain us, others give rise to life. 
The four agreements he is going to present are the latter.

Mitote : the sound of a thousand voices all trying to speak at once
Spoken to as a description of the spell of domestication on our minds


##### #### Chapter 2 The first agreement - be impeccable with your word

This is the most important but most difficult agreement.
But also the one that has the greatest power *as our word is our capacity to create.* 

Intent=life

Our intent is manifest through word, and thus our dream is manifest through word.
Words become thoughts/concepts/interpretations.
Like seeds, our word can germinate into a dream.

Alternatively, we might consider words like magic and the words we speak like spells we place on ourselves and others. 

With our word we can create hell and hate and violence..., or we can create heaven... with word we can align ourselves towards truth and beauty and freedom.


...

Impeccable means without sin.
"A sin is anything you do that goes against yourself" - page 31

But, what we do against others effects us as well, as anything that we do against others feeds back into our own lives. And thus to do something against an other is to do something againt ourselves. *Meaning that to be impeccable with our word is something we practice with others as much as with ourselves.*

...

**Gossip** is like black magic, dark spells, or a computer virus that can infect us and others and distort our reality in favour of the spell rather than truth and beauty and freedom.

To be impeccable with our word is to use the power of our word to break the spell of computer virus that run through us and to help others do the same.

....

Whenever we accept another persons opinion (their word) we forge an agreement within us, which eventually becomes a belief system. 
E.g. bad signing voice told to us once becomes a life of never signing because we belief we have a bad signi voice. 

People we love do this to us,  it they don't know what they do. They simply do what was done to them.

...

To be impeccable with our words helps us break gossip spells in others, and prevents them from bent planeted in us as it creates soil infertile to gossip.  It fertile to truth, beauty and love instead. It is with being impeccable with our word that we help create a dream where truth beauty and love are present, in ourselves and in the lives of those around us too.


###### #### Chapter 3 The second agreement - don't take anything personally. 

Taking things personally is making things about "me"
We are all taught growing up that everything is about "me" either explicitly p, or implicitly when other acts as if everything is about their "me".
However, this personal importance, me thinking, creates and stokes conflicts and suffering.. it leverages yourself on other peoples opinions. It gets us trapped in what other people say about us.
The same goes for the various parts of ourselves (and the agreements they represent) and their opinions of us.
Either good things or bad things. Either way, trapped.

When we don't take things personally, we know that other peoples opinions about us are actually about themselves. And vice versa for our own opinions about others. 
That we are reposible for ourselves, but not for others.
We also protect oursSelves from being drawn into gossip spells and hell.

Part of te chapter is about empowering us to stay away from relationships that attempt to impose dark spells of negative opinions on us, or places where we play out the dark opinions/beliefs we have taken upon ourselves (e,g. I don't derseve to be treated with respect)

**critique** 
although he is speaking about opinions here, and there is a lot of utility to the concept, this agreement can be taken too far and be used as a means of spiritual bypassing and gaslighting. Even on a less extreme level, some opinions matter and need to be taken seriously (if not personally) as getting feedback for the impact of our actions on others is an important part of learning to be in happy healthy relationships. 


##### #### Chapter 4 The third agreement - don't make assumptions

The problem with assumptions so that we believe they are true and real. And act accordingly. This can lead to conflict as those assumptions are not necessarily what's true or real and engaging as though they are can Lead to misunderstandings and create unnecessary friction and division. 

> **Quote**: it is always better to ask questions than to make an assumption, because assumptions set us up for suffering. (Page 65)

In relationships, for example, assumptions about who our partner is, or what (or how) they should or should not already know about us or the world or life (expectations or mind reading) can lead us into disappointments and offendedness and a sense of emotional trespass that directly stem from us believing that our assumptions about them (and about what they understand about us or life) are true and real and engaging accordingly. 

We also make assumptions about ourselves, over and under estimating ourselves in our capacity. And treat ourselves according (this ties back to being impeccable with our word and the harm of the inner judge and the book of law).

Assumptions are best kept at bay by asking questions. By engaging as though we do not yet know and must ask to know what true or real, while also holding the perepsective that even what we know from asking is never the whole picture. (Not assuming we know simply because we asked questions).

These assumption abiding questions also come through us developing our capacity to ask for what we need, letting other say yes or no. While also allowing others to ask for epwhat they need, and allowing ourselves to septa yes or no. ... this is to transcende the assumptions about what people do or do not want to do for us, with us, or have from us. Which helps us be in real relationships, rather than dynamics of assumptions.

**Criticisms**: on page 70 there is a bunch of talk about how in love relationship we make assumptions about who people are and who they can be and that we can change them to be who we want them to be and then blame them for not aligning with all those assumptions. The encouragement here is to not expect or attempt to have people change for us, as they will only change if they want to, which is fair and important. 

However, it goes on to stay something like real love simply is and doesn't expect or ask for change. That you just accept people fully for who they are and that's that. To me, this is foolish. Real love might simply be, but healthy relationships require effort and work and requires us to change for each other. Yes, accepting who they are, *and* asking for change and offering change in order to learn how to live in that love and the relationship in a healthy way is essential. To suggest that we simply need to only accept people and that be that or else it's isn't real love is preposterous and dangerous. 

Like the LSA says, everyone wants to be accepted for who they are and to change and those things are compatible. 

...

At the end of the chapter was a lot of talk about how, through the agreements, we can master things. Gain mastery over things like love and gratitude and life. As is mastery is an ultimate ends. For certain, being a skillful practioner of these things is valuable and a worthwhile goal and perhaps that's what he means, but the term mastery feels a bit gross for me. 



##### Chapter 5 The fourth agreement: always do your best 

To always do you best, no more no less, while recognizing tat your best is different in different contexts, on different days, and from different emtional places. It will have different quality at different times but it is continuing to do our best that matters, not the quality. 

It is also about recognizing that doing our best, no more no less, will include making mistakes and doing our best means learning from those mistakes. 

is about taking action mnthe previous agreements. That without action, there is nothing that comes of the previous three.  ... Yet not any action, doing our best is a choice of love and inclination to the doing our best itself, to the living itself. It is not actions taking due to expectations placed on us or im effort for reward. (That doing something for a reward leaves us wanting to do that thing even less over time lines up with dopamine system regulation.)

**Criticisms**: there is a lot of talk here about how doing our best means letting go of the past, and living the present moment. And the agreements themselves being about no longer living a life tied to our past, or to our desire to be accepted by others, or by other peoples expectations. And about living a life of control and mastery so as to have happiness. 

And this is fair and good in many ways, but it is also ripe for spiritual passing. The flight from our past, or from others acceptance, and towards happiness as a goal all sets us up for myopic me first life with spiritual explanations that justify selfishness and irresponsibility. With the other agreements in mind, not so much, but it still have that kind of me first individual spirituality that is, imo, starved of real spiritual value. 

Also, the flight from our past in service to a happier present leaves us without roots. Without connection to those who have come before. It rejects our ancestry and their suffering and their mistakes, and shucks  the responsibility of holding the pain and grief of our fellows, our forebearers, the earth, and even our own mistakes. As Jenkinson might say, it's a kind of truancy.


#### Chapter 6 The Toltec path to freedom

###### breaking old agreements 

[[freedom]], is being able to be who you truly are. To be wild and free to feel and express feelings and play and love and explore and so on. The kind of freedom we know at 2 and 3 years old. However, as we age and are conditioned into the dream of the world, of the belief system and book of law we develop/adopt/absorb over the course of our lives-and the judge and victim that come with it-we lose that freedom. We become constrained in ourselves by way of our conditioning. We limit our freedom and imprison ourselves internally. 

We confuse out lack of freedom and being due to the outside world. We project blame for the loss of our feeedom on others, big and small. When really it is within ourselves that we lack feeedom and of ourselves that we remain un free 

freedom then comes from *becoming a warrior* who rebels and defeats the parasite of the indoctrinated dream of the book of law and the judge and victim that limit our ability to be ourselves, by facing and overcoming our fears. 

**Criticisms**: this is very true on many levels, and geopolitical force developed over generations that have substantial power over us also limit our freedom in many ways. There needs to be a proper disambiguatiom between these two as they are not the same. However, for as long we we don't disambiguate them we are prone to the projection mentioned above (where we chase windmills thinking we are great warriors) --- while we are actually just harming others and ourselves in a broken attempt i to fix a problem from a direction that only imposes that problem onto others while deluding ourselves into thinking we are bettering it for ourselves --- or on the flip side submit to tyranny while deluding ourselves into the myopic self interest of asserting that because we feel free withi ourselves, no action need be taken. 

I supppose those, in both criticisms, holding the previous four agreements in mind would help mitigate those issues. Because being impeccable with our word means not speaking/acting in ways that harm others....

...


##### The art of transformations; the dream of second attention 


To transform is to change our inner agreements. Break old agreements and plant new ones. The defeat the parasite and become who we truly are. Doing so means first seeing the fog, the agreements we are already holding. In order to make change we need to know what it is we are wanting to change. 

This is the process of shifting from first attentions to second attentions

First attention is what is developed in the domestication process. It is what we are implanted with in growing up. Second attention is what we develop when we go in and break those old agreements to plant new ones, by conscious choice. To build new belief systems. 

##### the discipline of the warrior: controlling our own behaviour 

This chapter seems to discuss how the wounds inflicted on us through our life in domestication, by others and by ourselves, creates a kind of emotional poisiom (which is the negative emotions). We then spread that poison and suffer it internally by being controlled by our negative emotions.

In order to heal these wounds, we need to forgive those who harmed us--including ourselves and even god--which is possible due to self compassion.

Being a warrior is a way of healing these wounds and not spreading the poison within or outside ourselves. This is through control. Control of our emotional behaviour, which comes from the awareness of what is happening (that it is poison leaking from wounds and leaking power in the process) and then the discipline of staying in actioned alignment with who we truly are in a way that express our control of behaviour comin from our emotions.

In a negative emotion....
Where in a victim represses and projects, a warrior refrains and processes their emotions in a way that allows them to be expressed in a heldhty way and st the right time (no sooner no later)

**Criticisms**: I had to really effort to read into what's being said here as not being a kind of me-focused coercive relationship to reality and one's inner experiences or being. The whole concept of negative emotions being poison is garbage imo. It's more like unhealthy wounds become infected and make us sick and spread harmful elements to those around us. And that is not for, the emotions themselves but how they are processed and experienced. How we process our positive emotions might be just as "poisonous" if we consider impact beyond the self. Framing the emotions as bein poison because they are "negative", because we don't like those feelings, is not as helpful in achieving healing or an overall well-being in life. But if this framing I offered is held, the other descriptions offered here seem pragmatic and helpful. 

##### the initiation of the dead: embracing the angel of death

The final challenge of personal freedom is death and seeing death as our teacher. By seeing that our life can end anytime, we hold gratitude for each breath and love and live each day with fullness because life ends. (This links well to [[Stephen Jenkinson]] concept of grown up gratitudes).

In the teaching of death is not only the context that allows us the capacity for living life well, and doing well on to other because our last moments pull com anytime and having regrets for I'll deed weighing on us when we no longer have time to right them. It I also offer itself as a metaphor for the death of the judge and he victim, with a resurrection being the wakening of our capacity to be ourselves. 

**Criticisms** again the huge bypassing and focus on good feelings. He speaks explicitly of how we should live in a way that if we were to find out we were to die in 1 week that we are only happy because we still have a whole week to be alive. Like happiness is some ideal accomplishment and ultimate goal of a good life, and like being sad and grieving is a failure in our dying time. It's total new age bypassing garbage that serves only to distort people into not being themselves.
...
###### p
Do what makes you happy
What does it mean to be happy? Is it joyfulness only? Is it someaning that happens because something feels good now?


#### Chapter 7 The new dream
###### Heaven on earth

The subjective experience of our reality here in earth being either Heaven or hell is a choice. We have the power to create heaven on earth, if we choose it. But in order to we must be able to reclaim our power from the wastes of domestication and send it into the second attention of a new dream--based on new agreements. I'm doing so, we can live in and as love and from love wr can choose to be happy and no longer be in a ufferings, as suffering is a choice too. The parasite of domestication will resist, but if we are warriors in our fight with it we can prevail and enter into heaven on earth, free to be ourselves and dream the life we love.

**Criticisms**: this is a nice idea, with many pragmatic elements. But still, there seems to be this classic bypassing against negative emotions. That happiness is the goal and we can be happy all the time, and if we are not we are suffering and that we are suffering because we failed to be warriors enough to be happy. This is horse shit, imo. It vilifies essential aspect of our humanness, our sadness grief etc. It attempts to amputate necessary emotional feeling states due to their discomfort being undesirable and somehow failures in being spiritual enough. This can be resolved if the definitions of happiness and suffering were to include "happiness is being with what is happening in mature and graceful ways, even difficulty and even suffering itself" but I believe  this is me stretching my mind to compensate for the thesis' shortcomings. 

Furthermore, over and over there is the press that a happy life means being able to live without corner for the judgement of others or what others think. There is great utility in this on many levels, and especially when flipped back onto one's self in their judgement of others, whereby forgiving instead. However, the press that a warriors life of the happiness spiritual accomplishments is living without other's perspective or concerns or considerations of us being valid or with merit is again egregious bypassing. Another me-focused new ageism.

As well, forgiveness as something we simply do, just like that and and not forgiving being some kind oflack of being fully spiritual is another amputation of the complexity of human experience. As well as a kind of narrative that might allow for being mistreated, a kind of narrative that dangerous people can manipulate. Of course, that's worse case scenario, but if there is no thought or talk to this issue, the merits ad value of this book presentation collapses under the weight of those amputated and unaddressed aspect of human experience and interpersonal dynamics. 

Of course, maybe this is my parasite talking, fighting for control and keeping me away fro, happiness. Sure. But it's also concerning that it is presented that any thought that critiques this new age idealism is considered a parasite we are failing to defeat is a scary, slippery slope of gaslighting and manipulation.

*****

#### General appreciations

These four agreements themselves function as an excellent baseline for navigating life. They open a possibility space for agency and mature conduct. 

the concept of using imagination attention and perseverance to cultivate opthe mindset we experience reality towards one with greater capacity to transcend unnecessary suffering and harming others is also excellent. 

The concept of the personal dream and learning to break our domestication and no longer live in the rule of the parts of ourselves that represent that domestication also great. 



#### General Criticisms 

Multiple times he speaks to escaping the burden of the past to live in the present. Often times it comes off in a bypassing kind of way. Very rooted in the individual spirituality me-isms of the new age. IMO immature and myopic

The concept of letting Jugde and victim parts die, or seeing them as engines is contrary to ifs parts work which I have found to be a very  successful way of working through stuff. Far moreso then trying to defeat those parts. 

Many, many, examples of spiritual bypassing or at the least ideological avenues for bypassing.
