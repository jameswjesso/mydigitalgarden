## Personal Summary

>[!...]
>This book is a summary or the most impactful aspects of Grof's work over the years, and covers quite a bit of ground without going too deep into any particular aspect. Instead, he references which of his other books one can explore to go more deeply into any particular topic. 
>
>Present in this book are: healing with non-ordinary states, and a description of Hala tropic states. The cartography of the human psyche, which includes the biographical, perinatal and trans. Personal domains. His sense of the architecture of emotional and psychosomatic disorders. A description of spiritual emergencies, and how we can understand, and treat them as times of crisis and transformation. His general sense of how his work changes our understanding of the potential of psychotherapy; his general thoughts on spirituality and religion; as well as the experience of death and dying; when he calls the cosmic game "exploration of the farthest reaches of human consciousness"; and his sense of the evolution of consciousness and human survival, applying transpersonal perspectives on global crisis.

> I did not read this entire book. I may one day, but mostly picked it up to re-familiarize myself with this Cartagraphy Of The Psyche, specifically the basic perinatal matrices. The limited notes that follow reflect that.

## Notes

#### COEX Systems

A coex system is short for system of condences experience.  
It is presented as the organization structure of memeory, where the feeling state or theme is the centrally related object.  

Early experiences, especiallly those of the perinatal, work like the cynosure around which memories are constelated over time, with the more instense and the earliest as closest to the centre, and later ones being futher out; and the earliest ones being the furtherest from accessible memory and the more recent the easiest.

> A COEX system consists of emotionally charged memories from different periods of life that resemble each other in the quality of emotion or physical sensation they share. Each COEX has a basic theme that permits all that's layers and represents their common denominator. The individual layers then contain variations on this basic theme that occurred at different periods of the personâ€™s life. The unconscious of a particular individual can contain several COEX constellations. Their number and the nature of the central themes varies considerably from one person to another -- pg 22

#### Basic Perinatal Matrices

The BPMs (1-4) represent the different phases of birth and the qualities of experience they tend to illicit, and their psychological manifestations. 

This suggests that birth is an impactful and memorable experience for each person, although such memories exist as charged bundles of emotional energery in the nervous system, rather than as explicit memory. However, under the effects of psychedelic or in other holotropic states, one can reexperience these memories. Usually the emotional energy of such an experience is very intense and related to themes of birth and death and survivial, e.g. experiences that feel like dying. In these experiences we can experience explicit memories of our birthâ€”eg. forceps on our head or umbilical cord around our throatsâ€”or general emotional/somatic memories that donâ€™t have such clear source. 

Additionally, it is in these experiences that we can often encoutners more transpersonal material, such as identifying with whole groups or people in struggle (BPM3) or being inside (what we perceive as) a literal hell with no escape (BPM2).  

> When our process of deep, experiential, self-exploration moves beyond the level of memories from childhood in infancy, and reaches back to birth, we start encountering emotions and physical sensations of extreme intensity, often surpassing anything we previously considered humanly possible. At this point, the experience has become a strange mixture of the themes of birth and death. They involve a sense of a severe, life-threatening confinement in a desperate and determined struggle to free ourselves and survive -- pg29

Tim Read, in his interview with me on ATTMind 172 spoke of how connecting with the energies of the perinatal can manifest as a flood of transpersonal material, as though it is through the gateway of the perinatal that we connect with material the collective unconcsious (and vice versa)

The four basic perinatal matrices, as described by Grof are:

- First, basic perinatal matrix: BPM I (primal union with the mother)
- Second perinatal matrix: BPM II (cosmic engulfment, and no exit or hell)
- Third perinatal matrix: BPM III (the deathâ€“rebirth struggle)
- Fourth perinatal matrix: BPM IV )the death-rebirth experience)

A description of each of these are presented on pages 29-56
