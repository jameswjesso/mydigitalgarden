## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> MDMA increases desire and receptivity for closeness, which can be experienced as increased sexuality with decreased desire for actualy sexual activity. This seems to be related to prolactin release, creating what the authors called a post-orgasim like state.

## Notes

#### MDMA increases the sense of receptivity to being sexual according to self-reports, not the increase drive to sexual activity. 

MDMA increases the sense of receptivity to being sexual according to self-reports, not the increase drive to sexual activity. The sense is that this is because the sense of "being sexual" being increased is not the desire for sexual intercourse, but for the closeness people associate with sexual feeling.

> Although almost 50% of the subjects examined by Buffum and Moser [3] indicated that they felt more receptive for being sexual during the influence of MDMA, this effect was not paralleled by an increased interest in initiating sexual activity in either men or women. What most of the subjects reported as sexual receptivity seems to be mainly an increased emotional closeness. People may enjoy physical contact and feel love for others in the absence of a specific hunger for concrete sexual activityâ€”(Passie et al., 2005, p. 900)

#### MDMA triggers prolactin release up to 4 hours after ingestion

MDMA triggers increases in prolactin up to 4 hours after ingestion

> The time course of prolactin increase follows closely the pharmacokinetics of MDMA or MDEA with significantly elevated prolactin plasma levels up to 4 h after ingestion of the drugsâ€”(Passie et al., 2005, p. 900)

#### Increased presence of prolactin by way of MDMA is likely what leads to the decreased desire or capacity towards sexual intercourse,

Increased presence of prolactin by way of MDMA is likely what leads to the decreased desire or capacity towards sexual intercourse, as the presence of prolactin seems to mediate sexual desire and satisfaction (increases of prolactin post-orgasim has a role in sexual satisfaction and the refractory period)  
  
MDMA produces, then, something akin to a post-orgasmic state and its increases in prolactin are involved.

> In summary, several studies have demonstrated a marked increase of prolactin plasma levels after MDMA/MDEA consumption together with an impairment of sexual drive and function in humans. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest a possible role for prolactin in mediating a state of relaxation and sexual refractoriness after both orgasm and during the acute effects of MDMA/MDEA.â€”(Passie et al., 2005, p. 902)
