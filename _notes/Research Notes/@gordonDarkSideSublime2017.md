## Summary

An exploration of threat-based awe experiences compared to positive awe experiences, as the former is under represented in modern literature at the time of publication. 

They concluded that the presence of a sense of threat, often associated with feelings of powerlessness produced fear and anxiety responses to awe stimuli that resulted in not producing the positive effects on wellbeing that positive experiences of awe have been shown to produce, even compared to control. That they actually produce decreased in wellbeing compared to positive awe and neutral stimuli

##### The Two Varieties of Pride: authentic and hubristic

There are two varieties of pride, authentic and hubristic.

The former emerges from feelings of achievement due perceived as arising from effort and tend to have positive effect on self-esteem and general wellbeing.

The latter emerges from the perception of achievement being due to innate ability and is associated with "maladaptive consequences" such as "narcissism, aggressive behavior, and poor relationship functioning"

> Narrative and experimental work have characterized two distinct variants of pride—authentic and hubristic. Both variants arise from perceptions of having achieved something valued by others—pride’s central appraisal. However, these variants differ in their appraisals, subjective experience, and personality correlates. Authentic pride stems from the perception that one has achieved something through effort and is associated with healthier consequences, such as higher self-esteem, mental health, and relationship functioning (Tracy, Cheng, Robins, & Trzesniewski, 2009; Tracy & Robins, 2007). In contrast, hubristic pride stems from the perception that one has achieved something as a result of innate ability and is associated with more maladaptive consequences, such as narcissism, aggressive behavior, and poor relationship functioning (Tracy et al., 2009; Tracy & Robins, 2007).

##### Threat-based awe is due more to relationship to eliciting stimuli than the stimuli itself

Positive and threat-based awe have different emotional tones, namely that the latter has greater levels of fear and anxiety. However, the evidence suggests that this is the result more-so of one's relationship to the stimuli (their sense of powerlessness and/ or uncertainty) rather than the stimuli itself

> Feelings of awe were the dominant emotion for threat-based and positive awe, although the former was associated with greater reports of fear and anxiety. Threat-based and positive awe did not differ in their elicitors in two of the three studies assessing elicitors, suggesting that their distinctions cannot be reliably accounted for by differences in eliciting stimuli.

##### The presence of a sense of threat inform whether or not awe triggers are experiences positively or negatively

> Different reactions to the same stimuli might help explain this lack of association—the effects of awe may depend on whether or not awe is flavored by appraisals of threat. These data offer preliminary evidence for the influence of threat on physiological changes during awe, and should be complemented by experimental work (i.e., studies that manipulate threat-based vs. positive awe).

##### negative awe produces lowered wellbeing compared to neutral

Not only did negative experiences of awe not show any positive impact on wellbeing (whereas positive ones did) it resulted in reductions of perceived wellbeing compared to positive awe and even neutral stimuli

> Participants in the fear condition experienced the greatest reduction in well-being, significantly more so than the other three conditions.

...

##### Summary of results

> In sum, a threat-based experience of awe did not provide the same momentary boosts in well-being as a more positive awe experience. Moreover, this study showed that differences in wellbeing between threat-based and positive awe might be explained in part by heightened feelings of powerlessness during threat-based awe experiences.
