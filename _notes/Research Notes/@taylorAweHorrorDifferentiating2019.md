## Summary

Horror and Awe are different emotional states, although they are both states that comprise established models/schemas for reality.

##### Situations of schema challenge that are coherent with our schemas-model motivate positive change

If experiences are coherent within our schemas, then they motivate positive adaptive responses, but if they are not it can be more negative  

> If a situation is consistent with one’s cognitive schemata, it elicits an emotion that motivates adaptive behavioural responses (Keltner & Gross, 1999) and reinforces the schemata that guided it (Clore & Gasper, 2000).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 1)

...

##### Our models omit what challenges them

Our models resist and omit that which jeopardizes them in order to maintain their perceived validity and protect of from the disorientation of uncertainty

> Schemata are resilient against disconfirmation: information that does not fit is usually discounted, ignored, reappraised or revised to be consistent with current schemata (Lodge & Taber, 2000).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 2)

...

#### Schema are a cognitive result of of a deeper psychological need for creating security in interpreting reality

> schemata are “cognitive manifestations of psychological needs” (e.g. security, interpersonal belonging; McCann & Pearlman, 1990),

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 2)

As such, different kinds of schema/model incongruence trigger different kinds of responses depending on context

> Different types of schema incongruence elicit different responses, depending on what signals they give about the environment.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 2)

...

##### The Different Between Awe and Fear with respect to accommodation

Where as both are experience that trigger accommodation, awe and horror differ in that awe is triggered by vastness and horror extremity

...

##### A definition of extremity vs vastness

Wherein vastness challenges to our sense of the world and what's real and what's possible with respect to the grandeur/scale of things, triggering a need to update our schemas/models to adapt. Extremity (what results in horror) is a result violates our sense of what is allowable, and what's possible with respect to harms done.

> Vastness is a spatial or conceptual expansiveness that violates schematic scale expectations and reveals the limits of one’s knowledge.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 3)

> Extremity exceeds the limits of comprehensibility or presumed possibility, and is thus evaluated as “unthinkable” and elicits appraisals associated with horror, such as, “I didn’t think that something like this could happen” (Wierzbicka, 1988).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 3)

> In contrast, extremity typically contradicts or negates core schematic traits. In extremity (i.e. excessive conceptual distance from schematic norms), an entity (often a person) exhibits a trait or behaviour to a disproportionate degree that violates basic schematic criteria for category inclusion.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 3)

...

> For example, the schema of “parent” includes both protecting and disciplining one’s child. But a parent whose extreme “discipline” contravenes “protection” (e.g. starving a child as punishment) violates the “parent” schema.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 3)

### Awe and horror are different in their impacts on meaning structures

Awe and horror are different in their impacts on meaning structures... as awe tends to strengthen internal meaning structures, and those horror tends to undermine them.


> empirical and theoretical research indicates that awe and horror are different emotional responses to different types of schema incongruence. Awe is elicited by entities and actions that enhance and strengthen systems of meaning (Yaden, Haidt, Hood, Vago, & Newberg, 2017), such as art and moral excellence (Shiota et al., 2007). In contrast, horror elicitors, such as catastrophe and cruelty, undermine systems of meaning (Kristeva, 1982).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 3)

...

###### The difference between the fear of horror and the fear of awe

> the fear in awe and horror differ in several aspects. First, fear is central to horror, but peripheral and non-essential to awe (Bonner & Friedman, 2011; Keltner & Haidt, 2003). Second, whereas horror is a response to physical or existential damage (Cavell, 1979), the fearful aspects of awe are appraised as benign (Bonner & Friedman, 2011). Third, the fear in awe reflects respect or deference towards power (Keltner & Haidt, 2003), but in horror is antagonistic to the elicitor and rejects it as abhorrent and unnatural (Carroll, 1990; Kristeva, 1982). Fourth, horrified fear is a response to the realisation that actual harm is currently occurring or has occurred (Cavell, 1979), but fear in awe is felt towards the hypothetical harm a powerful elicitor could cause in the future (Kant, 1790/1951).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 3)

...

##### Awe expands our sense of the world, horror compromises our sense of safety

Awe tends to expand our sense of the world beyond us with respect to metaphysical beliefs and sense of connectedness,  
  
Whereas horror tends to challenge our models/mental structures relating to "safety, trust, power and self-esteem/intimacy"  

> Awe can expand ontological schemata beyond the material world, leading to metaphysical inferences (Valdesolo & Graham, 2014), feelings of personal connection with higher powers (Piff et al., 2015) and in-group members (Krause & Hayward, 2015) and a reduced sense of a personal self (Yaden et al., 2017). In contrast, horrifying experiences disrupt schemata related to safety, trust, power, self-esteem and/or intimacy (McCann, Sakheim, & Abrahamson, 1988).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 4)

...

##### The need for cognitive accommodation is higher in horror than awe

There was a significantly greater sense of uncertainty and thus need for cognitive accommodation in horror than either positive or threat based awe. Also, experiences of horror seemed to also be more difficult to integrate. 

> Contrary to Hypothesis 4, certainty was higher in Awe than in Horror. Other research similarly found that certainty was higher in positive awe than negative “threat-based awe” (Gordon et al., 2017), but the effect size observed here is three times larger. This could indicate that horror involves greater NFA [need for cognitive accommodation] than awe or that horrific NFA is more difficult to resolve (Dalgleish & Power, 2004). It is also possible that spontaneous meaning-making helps accommodate schema incongruence in awe (e.g. Valdesolo & Graham, 2014) but not in horror.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 5)

...
##### Perception of harm/threat in awe usually contains a sense of silver lining, none in that of horror

Experience of harm/death/threat in awe usually contains a perception of a sense of silver lining, but horror contained not sense of silver lining

> contained “silver linings” (e.g. altruistic self sacrifice, a dying person’s positive attitude), indicating that awe elicited by negative experiences often involves positive appraisals. In contrast, 86.9% of the horror scenarios were elicited by harm/death/threat (e.g. car crash, suicide), χ2 = 149.83, p < .001, and 0% contained silver linings, indicating no positive appraisals of horrifying situations.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 7)

...

##### Horror v. Awe elicitors - threat, silver lining, direct/cognitive experience

> Qualitative analysis indicated that awe and horror are elicited by different types of experiences. Horror was usually elicited by harmful events, but awe rarely was. Further, awe at harmful events was usually not felt toward the harm itself, but toward something positive occurring despite the harmful situation. Such “silver linings” were completely absent from horror scenarios. Additionally, horror (but not awe) was frequently elicited by information (rather than first-hand witnessing), indicating that “the mere thought of” schema-incongruent harm can elicit horror. In contrast, awe relies more on sensory perception (Shiota et al., 2007). Thus, unlike negative threat based awe, which has the same elicitors as positive awe (e.g. nature; Gordon et al., 2017), horror had distinctly different elicitors, providing further evidence that horror is not a fearful variant of awe.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 8)

...
##### Awe is transcendant vastness, Horror transgressive extremity

> awe and horror appear to be differentiable based on what type of schema incongruence is salient: transgressive Extremity in Horror, transcendent Spiritual Vastness in Awe.

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 8)

...

##### horror damages systems of meaning, horror tends to only arise from "senseless" harm

> The high Chaos in Horror (i.e. confusion due to contradictions of one’s beliefs and values) supports philosophical arguments that horrific things damage systems of meaning. It also indicates that not all harm elicits horror, only senseless harm that violates our values; morally justifiable harm may fail to horrify us (Rai, Valdesolo, & Graham, 2017).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 8)

...

##### Awe is easier to assimilate than horror  
  
Although all experiences can be integrated...

> the low NFA in awe raises the question of whether awe involves top-down assimilation. According to Fiedler and Bless (2000), assimilation involves “appetitive learning” (e.g. exploratory behaviour, selfefficacy, approach motivations) that alters stimuli to match schemata. With this in mind, many of awe’s effects indicate schema-driven assimilation rather than stimulus-driven accommodation (Bless & Fiedler, 2006; Fiedler & Bless, 2000): awe facilitates inferential abstractions (Valdesolo & Graham, 2014), strengthens pre-existing beliefs (Valdesolo, Shtulman, & Baron, 2016), expands “oceanic” categorisation (Shiota et al., 2007), increases exploratory behaviour

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 9)

...

##### Accommodation is not novel connections of creativity

whereas creativity is the creation, exploration, and expression of novel connections within ones schemas from within, accommodation differs as it is a process of actually altering ones schemas as a result of being confronted with experiences perceived as external to us and/or beyond us

> (e.g. using a greater number of unique actions to interact with a novel object; Colantonio & Bonawitz, 2018) and facilitates creative thinking (Chirico, Glaveanu, Cipresso, Riva, & Gaggioli, 2018). However, creating unusual or novel connections between semantically distant concepts does not transform or create new schemata. Creativity, imagination and play are assimilative processes that use internal schemata to identify conceptual similarities in external stimuli and shape the stimuli so they more clearly manifest schemata (Piaget, 1962). In contrast, in accommodation, the external stimulus alters internal cognitive structures so they more accurately reflect stimuli (e.g. imitation, not creativity).

(Taylor and Uchida, 2019, p. 10)

...

##### The adaptive functions of awe vs horror

Wherein awe seems to support group cohesion and bonding, horror seems to perhaps facilitate survival by trigger a "hard truths" confrontation and "inoculate" us against becoming disoriented in future experiences of extremity so as to protect our capacity to navigate it back to safety

> The differences between awe and horror indicate different adaptive functions (Keltner & Gross, 1999). It has been proposed that awe supports group-level fitness via the downstream social effects of collective bonding, such as broadened social resources (Stellar et al., 2017), prosociality and stabilised social hierarchies (Keltner & Haidt, 2003). In contrast, horror may facilitate individual survival via its effects on cognition. Horror involves recognition of painful truths that create a more complex worldview that “inoculates” against psychological malfunction (Janoff-Bulman, 2006) and stress-related impairments of working memory and executive function (Leach, 2012) during subsequent extreme situations.
