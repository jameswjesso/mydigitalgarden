>[!Abstract]
> In a large-scale ( N = 1487) general population online study, we investigated the relationship between past experience with classic psychedelic substances (e.g. LSD, psilocybin, mescaline), nature relatedness, and ecological behavior (e.g. saving water, recycling). Using structural equation modeling we found that experience with classic psychedelics uniquely predicted self-reported engagement in pro-environmental behaviors, and that this relationship was statistically explained by people’s degree of self-identification with nature. Our model controlled for experiences with other classes of psychoactive substances (cannabis, dissociatives, empathogens, popular legal drugs) as well as common personality traits that usually predict drug consumption and/or nature relatedness (openness to experience, conscientiousness, conservatism). Although correlational in nature, results suggest that lifetime experience with psychedelics in particular may indeed contribute to people’s pro-environmental behavior by changing their self-construal in terms of an incorporation of the natural world, regardless of core personality traits or general propensity to consume mind-altering substances. Thereby, the present research adds to the contemporary literature on the beneficial effects of psychedelic substance use on mental wellbeing, hinting at a novel area for future research investigating their potentially positive effects on a societal level. Limitations of the present research and future directions are discussed.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> After outlining what nature relatedness is, and its 3-sub domains, they explain how the results of their servey study showed that lifetime classical psychedelic use increases the NR-Self domain of nature relatedness, and that pro-envrionmental behaviour is an indiect result of this increase. Also that other substances, including natural ones, did not show this increase in NR-self or other NR domains.

#### Increased self-nature overlap in self-construal being a result of ego dissolution in natural environments

The propose that one of the potential reasons for why peoples have psychedelic-induced increases in the overlap of nature within their self-construals is due to the experience of ego-dissolution within natural environments. 

The results of this study, however, doesn't necessarily reveal immersion in nature as a requirement for these changes in self-construal. It also doesn't eliminate it.


> One common mystical experience encountered by many during the psychedelic state is a profound feeling of connectedness or unity—a presumed consequence of a loss of self-awareness or ego-dissolution (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016).—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 2)
> ...
> This substance-induced self–nature overlap can potentially be understood as a consequence of the ego-dissolution experienced under the influence of psychedelics (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), and may have unique cognitive and behavioral consequences for the person experiencing it. Social psychological research shows that self–other overlap can be understood as an embodiment of a close relationship, and that it is intimately linked to empathic concern (Aron et al., 1991). Moreover, it typically causes an incorporation of the target’s features into the self (Aaron et al., 1991), and conversely, an ascription of one’s own characteristics to the target (Galinsky et al., 2005).—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 3)

#### Mind Perception is the attribution of mind and feelings to an entity and plays an important role in empathy and morality -- anthropomorphizing

Mind perception is a common term to describe the attribution of a mind and feelings onto an entity. Irrespective of whether that is an accurate assessment of that entity's subjective experiences, doing so enables us the capacity to care for and relate to it.

Their proposition is that through our anthropomorphizing of various aspects of nature we enable ourselves to relate to those aspects in ways that enable caring, empathy, and relatability where there may otherwise have been none. This, they propose, would then increase the likelihood of us acting in pro-environmental ways as we are more inclined to want to avoid harming this entity we now have empathy for.


> Attributing a mind and feelings to an entity is a process commonly referred to as mind perception. As put by Gray et al. (2012), mind perception can be considered the “essence of morality”, in that it enables empathic concern for any given entity. Acknowledging that an entity has emotions and feelings is a prerequisite for considering it a moral patient, that is, something that can feel pain and that should hence not be harmed. In line with this reasoning, anthropomorphizing certain elements of nature was found to foster an empathic connection with the natural world (Tam et al., 2013). An evocation of empathy, in turn, is one of the central causes for altruistic behavior, which—in the case of nature—would manifest in increased pro-environmental behavior.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 3)

> In sum, there is an empirical connection from psychedelics to experiencing unity and connection with one’s environment to empathy-related phenomena and pro-environmental behavior.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 3)

> They have basically included everything that is even remotely charaterized as psychedelic, including dissociatives, entactogens (they call them empathogens here), the tropanes, and even amanita muscaria. This would seem to polute results a bit. I hope they delinate results from each category. 
>
>^^^ They did not delinate in any particular way, but they did remove the tropanes from the results due to the number of people reporting their use being so low.
>> we had to drop the latent variable for natural deliriants from the model, as less than 1% of our sample had experience with any of the three substance groups that comprise it (—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 7)

#### Nature relatedness as a less stable personality trait that includes self-construal and relationship with nature and natural environments

Nature relatedness as a less than especially stable personality trait (or domain) that includes self-construal and relationship—both affectively and conceptually—with nature and natural environments.

What makes is less than especially stable is that it can alter significantly. Psychedelics increasing it, for example.

> Nature relatedness is a considerably stable personality trait that captures people’s ecological self-construal, or ecological identity, and thus centers around their perceived connectedness with the natural world. Unlike past constructs, it includes people’s affective, cognitive, as well as physical relationship with nature, and therefore involves both people’s concrete feelings towards outdoor environments, as well as their abstract understanding of their interconnectedness with all living beings on this planet.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 5)

#### The 3 Sub-dimension of Nature Relatedness

The personality domain of nature relatedness had 3 sub-dimensions.

- The NR Self, which is essentially our ecological identity or how much our sense and model of self (self construal) overlaps with and includes nature
- NR perspective, which is our attitude towards nature and our engagement with it.
- NR experiences, which includes perspective but also our affect towards nature and being in nature, such as our attraction to and desire to be in nature or natural environments and what it feels like for us while we are in nature or natural environments.

> According to the authors, the construct of nature relatedness (NR) can be separated into three sub-dimensions, labeled NR-Self, NR-Perspective, and NR-Experience, representing different facets of a person’s relationship with the natural world (Nisbet et al., 2009).—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 5)

#### Lifetime psychedelic positively impacts the degree of nature relatedness, especially NR-Self

==Lifetime psychedelic positively impacts the degree of nature relatedness, especially NR-Self.==

> In sum, while correlational in nature, the present research tentatively suggests that experience with classic psychedelic substances may uniquely and positively affect people’s relationship with nature, especially their self-construal with regard to how strongly they see themselves as being part of nature rather than being separate from it. This, in turn, seems to positively affect their everyday behavior, in that they report to make more ecology-friendly decisions in the domains of energy consumption, waste management, or shopping behavior.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 11)

Wherein, the more their self-construal was interwoven with the natural environment, the more likely they were to engage in pro-environmental behaviours. 

Effectively, this ==change in pro-environmental behaviour is an indirect result of changes to NR self due to lifetime classical psychedelic use.==

> As lifetime experience with classic psychedelics exclusively predicted the NR-Self dimension, and this dimension uniquely predicted participants’ self-reported proenvironmental behavior, we tested whether this indirect path would explain any direct effect of experience with psychedelics on pro-environmental behavior—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 7)
>...
> we found that increases in NR-Self indeed mediated the effect of experience with classic psychedelics on pro-environmental behavior.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 9)
> ...
> In other words, the effect of lifetime experience with classic psychedelics on proenvironmental behavior is partially accounted for by the extent to which people’s self-construal incorporates the natural world.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 9)
> ...
> NR-Self, in turn, was the only dimension of nature relatedness that positively predicted self-reported engagement in proenvironmental behavior, and significantly mediated the relation between experience with classic psychedelics and pro-environmental behavior.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 10)


There was also linear relationship between change in NR-Self and NR-Experiences when it came to the changes in NR resulting from lifetime psychedelic use. 

Effectively, ==the more experiences with psychedelic people had, the more they enjoyed being in natural environments.==

> We found a linear relationship between lifetime experience with classic psychedelic substances and scores on two sub-dimensions of nature relatedness, NR-Self and NR-Experience. The more people had experience with classic psychedelics the more they enjoyed spending time in nature, and the more they construed their self as being a part of nature. None of the other substance classes included in our model significantly predicted any of the nature relatedness dimensions individually.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 10)
  

#### Increases in nature relatedness is unique to psychedelics over the other drugs tested

The Increases in nature relatedness seen in this study are unique to psychedelics compared the other drugs tested—cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine

> classic psychedelics remained the only significant predictor of nature relatedness. In all alternative models, we found a statistically significant mediation of the NR-Self dimension (or in Model 4 the overall NR-Score) in the relationship between lifetime experience with classic psychedelics and pro-environmental behavior.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 9)

#### Limitations of this study and their rebuttal

It is possible that due to this study being a matter of correlation through self report, the nature relatedness changes and psychedelic use may not be causal from the direct use of psychedelics. That it may be the case that people who related strongly with nature are more likely to take psychedelics, and not that psychedelics make people more likely to relate to nature.

> Correlational designs—such as the one employed in this research project—suffer from the disadvantage that the directionality of the effect observed is unknown. That is, from an empiric standpoint, it may equally be the case that people who feel greater nature relatedness have a greater propensity to take psychedelic drugs. Because of the correlational nature of our study, we can only argue against this proposition on a theoretical level.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 10)

...

HOWEVER, they propose this to be unlikely because it comes with the assumption that people who like to be in nature have a greater affinity to taking nature-derived substances, such as many of the classical psychedelics. But, there is "no reason to believe" that people with high NR-self are more likely to take psychedelics, and that they are more likely to take psychedelics over other natural psychoactives—such as tobacco, opiates, deliriants, etc.—which did not show any correlation between their use and nature relatedness. 

So even if high NR-self leads people to be more likely to consume natural substances, it doesn't mean they are more likely to take psychedelics specifically, which were the only substances whose lifetime use correlated with increased nature relatedness. 
 

> For the reversed link, however, this is not the case. There is no reason to believe that people who see nature as an integral part of their selves are more prone to taking psychedelic substances, but show no greater affinity to take other classes of psychoactive substances. For example, while many of the classic psychedelic compounds can be found in nature—thereby potentially explaining a correlation with nature relatedness—the same is true for cannabis, some opiates, tobacco, or deliriants, which did not have significant explanatory power in our study. Thus, the idea that natural substances are more likely to be consumed by people who feel a stronger relatedness to nature cannot explain the present results.—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 11)

....  

They also point out how it would be difficult to explain why it would be that people who have higher NR-self specifically would be more likely to take psychedelic drugs, especially when high NR-perspective and NR-experiences do not directly correlated with psychedelic use. 

> In addition, it would be theoretically difficult to explain how specifically the NR-Self dimension—that is, the inclusion of nature in people’s self-construal—would cause people to consume more psychedelic drugs, whereas this would not be the case for their general appreciation of being outdoors (NR-Experience) or strong political views with regards to environmental issues (NR-Perspective)—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 11)

....  

They also point out that the results of their study still pointed to lifetime psychedelic use increasing NR-Self even after controlling for other "demographic variables" and personality traits that may incline a person to take psychedelics. Thus, its unlikely that their results of their study were the result of being simply an observation of "hippies" like to take trips. 

> Lastly, as the relationship we found remained significant after controlling for demographic variables and personality traits such as openness to experience, conscientiousness, or political attitudes, it is unlikely that the association we found can be entirely explained by a collection of personality traits stereotypically associated with psychedelic users (e.g. being of the “hippie” type).—(Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017, p. 11)
