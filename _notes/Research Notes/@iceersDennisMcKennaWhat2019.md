## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> Dennis McKenna share his perspective on plant intelligence as something observable through the complex systems of interaction and communication facilitated through secondary signalling molecules, at the plant to plant level, ecosystem level, and planetary level. He also presents that this communication and the networks that allow for it amount to the planetary neural network of the Gaian mind, with secondary messenger molecules acting like neurotransmitters.

## Notes

#### We don't need brains for intelligence, but neural networks. 

We don't need brains for intelligence, but neural networks. 
These occur in animal nervous systems, but can also in natural systems too. This is explored more in the notes further down. [04:38]

...

#### The brain is an organ of signal transduction

Signal transduction is the process of information exchange involving molecular, chemical messengers. 
This happened within the human body, through hormones, enzymes, etc. but it is through neuronal signalling in the human brain, facilitated through neurotransmitters. [06:29]


#### Human neurotransmitters evolved from common progenitor to neurotransmitter-like compounds in plants

Neurotransmitters evolved from the same evolutionary precursors that gives rise to the neurotransmitter-like molecules we can find in plants, e.g. psychedelic molecules [08:54]

Those same molecular pre-cursors that became animals neurotransmitters likely played a key role in the evolution of communication networks within ecosystems. [09:29]

#### Photosynthesis as the harnessing of cosmic energy


Plant have learned to harness cosmic energy from the sun and transform it (photosynthesis) into "and enormous variety of organic molecules". [14:09]

### Secondary compounds are messenger molecules

Secondary compounds are not needed for life basic life, but serve as a messenger compounds (signal transduction) [15:29]

#### Plants substitute biosynthesis for behaviour

Secondary messenger molecules are used to mediate relationships within their environment and the other creatures, flora and fauna, with that environment. 

[16:47]

#### Defence, semiosis, symbiosis

The main functions of these mediating messenger molecules are defence, semiosis, symbiosis.

Defence is protection, such as repellents or toxins.
Semisosis - (? this was not explored in depth, but was just referred to as signalling)
Symbiosis is the creation of alliances between species that serve mutual benefit.

[17:43]


#### Plant secondary compounds are the neurotransmitters of the Gaian mind.

Mediation and modulation of the relational dynamics of various participants in a given ecosystem function through signal transduction allows for life to exits in both smaller scale ecosystems, and concentrically integrated into the planetary system we call the biosphere.

#### Mother trees and Mycelial networks are neural networks for the forest

The hyper-connected systems of mycelial networks in forests function like neural networks, allowing for signal transduction communication and feedback between the various plants within the forest. Allowing for the forest as a whole to respond to threat. (In old growth forests, this seems to be facilitated centrally through the oldest trees, called mother trees) [19:17]


#### The neural networks of the Gaian mind.

The complex networks of communication that comprise the various ecosystems of the biosphere are the neural network of the Gaian mind. [22:00]

#### Geophysiology

The various aspects of the functioning of the planet as a wholeâ€”geosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphereâ€”function together similar to the way in which various systems within the body function to regulate the physiology of the body as a whole. Functioning through complex systems of feedback and adaptation, helping to maintain homeostasis, facilitated through symbiosis. [24:02]


#### Aspen forests are singular trees

Aspen trees within a cluster are all clones of each other. They are not separate tress, but many stems of the same tree. [28:46]
