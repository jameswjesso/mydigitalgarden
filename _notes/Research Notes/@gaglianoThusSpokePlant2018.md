>[!Abstract]
>The eighteenth-century naturalist Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) argued that plants are animate, living beings and attributed them sensation, movement, and a certain degree of mental activity, emphasizing the continuity between humankind and plant existence. Two centuries later, the understanding of plants as active and communicative organisms has reemerged in such diverse fields as plant neurobiology, philosophical posthumanism, and ecocriticism. The Language of Plants brings together groundbreaking essays from across the disciplines to foster a dialogue between the biological sciences and the humanities and to reconsider our relation to the vegetal world in new ethical and political terms.
>
>Viewing plants as sophisticated information-processing organisms with complex communication strategies (they can sense and respond to environmental cues and play an active role in their own survival and reproduction through chemical languages) radically transforms our notion of plants as unresponsive beings, ready to be instrumentally appropriated. By providing multifaceted understandings of plants, informed by the latest developments in evolutionary ecology, the philosophy of biology, and ecocritical theory, The Language of Plants promotes the freedom of imagination necessary for a new ecological awareness and more sustainable interactions with diverse life forms.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This is a book that explores plant intelligence, both from the perspective of emperical research done by Gagliano, as well as the experiential perspective of her encounters with plant intelligence personally.
> 
> She presents plants as  not only intelligent, but also sovereign entities with whom we can not only develop relationships with but must alter our perspectives of if we are going to solve the global ecological (and increasingly economical) problems that are resulting from our present perspective and use of plants as mere commodies. 
> 
>Her journey from material scientist to the person she is today is beauitufl, as is the poetic ways in which she shares not only her discoveries from the plants she has studied scientifically but those she developed relationships with as well. In that, she weaves these exeperience and discoveries into perspectives on humanity, nature, our relationships with nature, and the larger systems of through which humanity interacts with (and harms) the Natural world.
>
>Many of her perspectives feel radically ahead of her time, and perhaps beyond what modern humans will ever be able to actually integrate into socio-ecomonic systems of practices given where we are as a species just now. But, they feel valuable to have read and to hold as potentials to consider at the very least.

## Notes

#### The object of my research became a subject for my learning

Gagliano is reflecting on her time doing research on fish (and other creatures) that required dissection, and how her ability to do "science" as she was taught to do it changed the moment she began to see these creatures as living beings and not an object of research. At this moment, research become learning. 


> Today, this pondering fills me with a great sense of awe. At the time, however, when this species was the main object of my scientific research, their commitment to life didn’t stop me from fulfilling the murderous necessity of science. It was so until the fish ceased to be an anonymous data point on a spreadsheet, just another “fish” in the agreed sense of the word the human-centered categorical boundaries asserted through to the Linnaean classification system, a fiction brought into being by a particular worldview. Once it was no longer an elusive entity void of individuality, the object of my research became a subject for my learning. And everything changed.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 4)

#### Quote about enlightenment science and the blood sacrifice

[[A blood sacrifice to the old gods of the Enlightenment]]

#### The Human is not interpreter of the plant, but the listener

She presents how there are sections in the book where the plant speaks, and that "the human" (her in this case, but we could put ourselves in that position) are not creating the plant voice in their heads, as if a fiction that they derive ideas as if it came from the plant. But instead, managing the elimination of the "noise" of their personal thoughts and ideas such that the plant's voice can actually be heard enough to be listened to, and from there a dialogue can happen. 


> Here, the human is not an interpreter who translates a mental representation in her head as if it were plant-speak and then puts it into words we can comprehend or scribbles it on a page we know how to read. Rather, the human is a listener who filters out personal noise to hear plants speak, who engages in active dialog with these nonhuman intelligences, which are far more real than our current scientific constructs allow us to contend with.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 6)

....  

#### Dieta for a plant is only needed once

In speaking on the learning of a plant through the indigenous (vegatalismo) tradition of dieta, one only need diet the plant once. After which point, their teaching stays with you and continues to teach you over time.


> once dieted, a plant is a teacher that will stay with you forever and keep teaching you in her own plant time; because of that, there is no need to diet the same plant twice.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 13)

....  

#### It is through feeling and not thinking that we communicate with plants


The sense that communicating with plants is unthinkable is because it is, it cannot be done through thinking. It is something that happens through feeling. We feel the plants, with feeling as a means of perceiving the external cues of encoded meaning offered by the plant in our relationship and dialogue with it.

*This strongly links with [[@buhnerSecretTeachingsPlants2004|The secret teachings of plants]] presentation of feeling-perception as the means to communicate with plants.*


> this plantness has seemed inaccessible and even deliberately hidden from us. Well, that is true when we try to think of it. It is because of its unthinkability—in the sense that it cannot be comprehended in a conceptual way—that only the experience of feeling it (by virtue of the patterns of information that it delivers) makes it real. When we feel it, this plantness is allowed to emanate unconcealed within us at all times. What appeared to be intangible—an obscure otherness—is unveiled as the intimate familiarity of an obvious and luminous likeness. And far from being impenetrable and distant, the plant is revealed as unquestionably open.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 14)

....  

#### The deep listening of feeling is not empathy

She presents deep listening as the act of "feeling the other" that allows for communications. She then clarifies how empathy and deep listening through feeling are not the same. We do not figure and project ourselves onto the plant in order to emotionally relate our own feelings to our perception of the plant. We position ourselves such that the plant is its own entity and the feelings that arises in our deep listening are not made by a predetermined condition for relatability, but as the consequence are being open without expectation or need for relatability.


> This availability to truly listen by feeling the other as we meet is not empathy, which bears upon the empathizer projecting and depositing himself into the other in order to rediscover himself—a form of narcissism that makes the other a sort of imaginative variation of the empathizer. Instead, knowing by deep listening has the quality of a perfect surprise, pertinent to the moment of the encounter, not conditioned by anything inside one or the other and, thus, not intentionally predetermined.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 15)

....  

#### The limitation of the purely abstract thinking scientific determinism

The results of knowledge gather through the lens scientific determinism—objective and material—as being the primary (and at times) only knowledge warranting a recognition of validity has resulted in conventional science becoming a reservoir of information detached, "abstracted", from the lived experience of being human, in "body, mind, and the spirit". 

> With its quest for a source of intellectual security based on objectivity and materialism, the modern scientific mode of thinking—scientific determinism—has become the accepted procedure for gaining knowledge about the world and a common denominator for Western culture. As a result, the knowledge attained by conventional science is, for the most part, an intellectual enterprise abstracted from the subjective experience of the body, the mind, and the spirit.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 19)

....  

#### The psychosis of seeing plants as commodities rather than beings - capitalism and colonialism

The perception of plants as commodities—as having no personhood, intelligence, or inherent life value beyond the values determined by human perception—is a kind of psychosis that is encouraged by and allows for the pillage, piracy, and depreciation of not only plants themselves and natural landscapes from which they are taken (or destroyed in order to be grown as commodities) but also pillage, piracy, and depreciation of traditional and/or indigenous perspectives, lands, and cultures. This latter issues is because their recognition of plants as persons physically and spiritually threatens the profit system that requires the ongoing psychosis of plants as mere commodities. 


> At its worst, this disconnection reveals one of the many faces of colonialism: the capitalist agro-scientific psychosis whereby plants are seen as commodities to be taken without sanction and the wealth of traditional knowledge regarding them is used without permission. Illogical and offensive, the first order of business of scientific colonialism—also known as biopiracy or bioprospecting, for a more politically correct designation of the same—is to devalue plants and the traditional knowledge of them. By disregarding both the physical and the spiritual personhood of plants and depreciating the traditional knowledge held by indigenous and local communities about them, the scientific colonizers are busy convincing everyone that whatever product they have to offer is superior—better than the unsubstantiated and fanciful belief system preserved as traditional knowledge and certainly wiser than the spiritual pretexts that that system has concocted to prevent its knowledge claims from being scrutinize according to the Western scientific model.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 23)

#### To explore without expectation or preconception violates scientific orthodoxy

According to Gagliano, her research was disregarded as valid because she wasn't going in with a decided perspective (hypothesis) she was attempting to prove that hypothesis, but instead was going in with open questions and without expectation and experimenting to see what might happen. Despite the " methodological, analytical, or other technical" aspects of that research being rigorous and reliable, that research was still disregarded because, according to her, it violated scientific orthodoxy.

> During the peer-review process of this work, it was pointed out that the approach used was not the way scientific research is normally carried out. There is usually an idea that a particular factor could significantly affect a process under consideration, and the experiment is designed to prove the significance of this factor. To allow for the unexpected to happen with no preconception about what one is even looking for seemed unorthodox, and it was this unorthodoxy that was perceived as an infringement of the conventional touchstone for scientific legitimacy. And in a sense, the approach was transgressive indeed—irritatingly free of actual methodological, analytical, or other technical faults, it was violating the ontological boundaries of a science made for humans and exclusively by humans.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 29)

....  

#### Plant voice exists in relation, when we allow them to speak

The ability to hear the voice of plants is dependant on our inclination and capacity to give them a voice through how we show up to listen. In this way, the voice of plants is something that can only be revealed through the reciprocity cultivated in our relationship with them.


> By merely asking the question about plant voice, we set ourselves free from the preconceived notion that construes plants as inevitably voiceless, and we open ourselves to observing plants as they actually behave and to discovering the reality we share. That’s right, because voice is an inter-subjective affair. Voice exists in the place of relation, the space between the self and the other, and it is what we bring to our encounters with plants that defines the quality of our communicative rendezvous—those we allow to speak (or those we silence). If there truly is a plant voice, how does it speak? How can we hear it? The voice of the vegetal other is revealed in a place of reciprocity.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 32)

....  

#### Silencing voices to ignore those we do not wish to hear

She speaks to how humans, not only with plants but with each other, have a history of finding ways to silencing those we would rather not heard be heard. This act removes the other as an equal and in doing so eliminates the possibility of dialogue.

> humans have something of a track record for silencing those whose voice they do not want to hear. We do this by unconsciously ignoring them or deliberately stripping them away, and ==this is an injurious act because it violates the very thing that makes dialogue possible—the recognition of the other as an equal==.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 34)


....  

#### The gift of anxiety is to reveal one's edges

She presents anxiety as a kind of emotional cue that signals one's edges to themselves. 

In this way, she presents anxiety as a messenger and what it reveals can be gifts to our journey healing, learning, and change. As it is change that is necessary to end that anxiety, not coping or understanding or resolution, but a change in perspective such that the "anxiety simply disappears". This change re-defines our edges and opens possibilities for excitement and joy where there was previously anxiety and limitation.


> Years later, I would learn what my experience of emotions like anxiety was really about and how to harness these emotions’ gifts—yes, gifts. ==Anxiety, for example, is a valuable messenger, one that speaks of my prevailing belief construct and its sphere of influence.== This belief construct is like a container, which I take to be objective reality, and anxiety always arises to alert me when I have reached the edge of the container. Anxiety speaks of the uneasiness of staying within the container’s fortified walls once their restrictive presence is felt, and in this rests its precious gift—the call to break down the walls of personalized assumptions and outgrown perspectives, the invitation to realize new possibilities, when my current restricted understanding sees only impossibilities. This is why coping with anxiety does not really stop the anxiety; the answer is not in understanding and resolving anxiety, but in changing perspective so that anxiety simply disappears. When it happens, the precious gift it brings is one of joy and excitement for life. Back then, however, I had no appreciation of this, so I simply tried to cope.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 42)

#### A beautiful poem about memory, knowing, and letting knowing go

> No knowledge is ever lost; nothing can ever be forgotten. Carefully held by the trees, the memory of our knowledge is continually scribed by the land. How do we know it once more? We need to forget what we think we know to remember what we truly do know. We need to remember that memory, in its distinctiveness, is never a private something that belongs to one; rather, it is a shared heritage constantly reimagined in the body of the whole. Flickering in the space of experience between all kinds of relationships, memory is a dynamic witness to all relating. Our remembering of relationships mineralizes the bones of the future, the endless possibilities for the exchange of intrinsic vibrancies, growing afresh in becoming something of another. Hence, nothing is ever forgotten, only constantly re-membered from a matrix of information that sparks the future into present being. We are here to remember the future, reverberating whole galaxies toward us as we breathe in.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 52)

....  

#### Memory as an ecological dynamic of meanings shared and shaped

She presents here that the capacity for memory and communication of meaning shared through relationships as an ecological process that gives rise to perceptions, behaviours, further interactions, and new foundations for new meanings to be made, shared, and acted from.

> Because memories are born of and come into existence within and through relationships of all kinds, as an ecologist, I saw memory as a feature of a truly ecological, dynamic process of relationships, where meanings emerge to shape the production of behaviors that, in turn, shape new interactions for new meanings to emerge.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 63)

#### We see the world through one perspective, the world sees us from all perspectives


As a entity with a singular perspective, we only see the world through that one perspective. However, the world sees us from all perspectives, which is something we often don't acknowledge.

In this way, the world can see us in our multidimensionality as persons, wherein we can only see ourselves within certain lanes of potential (often guided by the cyclical influence of emotional disposition)


> ==We believe we see only because of the presence of light, but it is in the dark that light becomes visible. From the encounter of light and darkness we are born, and with us, the world emerges. Constantly molding the world around us with our gaze, we in turn are molded by the gaze the world presses upon us.== Unaware of this interplay of luminosities, we rarely recognize that all we see is seeing us. Rarely do we realize that by virtue of its being all around us, the penetrating gaze of the world sees us, at all times and from all sides, in our multidimensionality. We, however, see the world from a one-sided standpoint only: the frontal view. As in single-point perspective drawing, we make the object of our most immediate gaze look realistic and three-dimensional, while most of the world is distorted and lost away to a vanishing point in an illusory distance.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 75)


....  

#### We cannot feel safe in an uncontrollable world we believe we must control to feel safe in

We need to feel safe. However, we often conflate safety with control. 

Safety is not necessarily control, though, and when it comes to the world, our perception that it is something that should control in order to ascertain and confirm our safety creates an impossible dilemma because the world is fundamentally uncontrollable. 

Thus, as long as we feel we must control it to be safe, we will never actually feel safe in the world.

> Throughout human history, we have constructed boundaries to define reality in an attempt to soothe our need to feel safe in our own skin and at home in a world we are, fundamentally, so afraid of. Threatening the very thing they promised to protect—our feeling of being safe—these boundaries are, and always were, fictional walls that restrict our understanding of who we truly are and that replace clear seeing with misconception—the illusion that we need to control a world we have no control over. Our need to feel safe (and, correspondingly, the feeling of not being safe) in the world seems inextricably linked to our need to control it. But what if we were to realize that the only reason we feel unsafe in the world is because we believe we need to control it? As the sacred jungle Tobacco would teach me a year later, we have no control over the circumstances that face us until we surrender the need to control them. ==As long as we need to control our circumstances, we also need to feel unsafe and insecure about them, because the two states are bound together in a self-perpetuating and irreconcilable loop that goes something like this: we try to control because we feel unsafe and believe that by controlling our world, we will feel safe in it—and yet we never do, and we cannot feel safe in the world if we keep believing that the world needs controlling because, without our control, there is something unsafe about it.==—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 79)

#### The Green House as a symbol of the sheltered ideologies of elitism

> the greenhouse has also sheltered ideologies of elitism, protecting the complex mélange of power, knowledge, and wealth represented by exotic plants.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 84)

#### Problems materializing unpredictably produce incredible opportunities

Problems will and so arise unpredictably such that they disrupt our plans. This is clearly something that can be challenging and feel frustrating. However, these events can offer us incredible "insights and opportunities" if we are able to roll with them.

I believe that the ability to see these unpredictable events as opportunities in positively benefits from holding [[A Skillfully Open-Mind]]


> Over the years, I had learned that seemingly problematic issues that materialize unpredictably and demand a change in existing plans can feel frustrating, but they often bear immensely productive insights and opportunities if I am prepared to stay open to alternatives.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 89)

....  

#### We cannot better our current global situation as long as we continue to believe in a self in separated from the world

As some point in the book, Gagliano asks

> why do we seem so incapable of taking the steps and actions required to create a world where conflict, poverty, and environmental devastation are things of the past? —(Gagliano, 2018, p. 79)

One of her propositions with respect to this questions is related to our sense of self as separate from Nature, and from the whole of life. And that we cannot better our current global situation as long as we continue to believe in that self separated from the world because in that separation we are able to act in ways that harm the world, while guarding ourselves from the consequences because we perceive the world we harmed as not-us. 

> It is, then, the quality of our actions that tells the story of who we are and where we are going. Unfortunately, many of our current actions are violent, and we are living in the delusion that we can distance and guard ourselves from their consequences, as if our well-being is separate from that of the whole. Well, we cannot. We cannot because the notion that there are independent objects, each fighting for dear life in a Darwinian struggle of existence, is a lazy and archaic conjecture that does not do justice to contemporary scientific findings. ==There are no conflicting opponents, even when two organisms appear to have mutually exclusive properties; there is only the remarkable play of one nature displayed across a palette of rainbow colors.== However, ==until we see ourselves inhabiting a world of polarities, we can only perceive ourselves in conflict with the whole==—and our neurotic violence keeps chasing and biting at our own figurative tail.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 91)

#### GMO plant research is ethically wrong because plants of sovereign entities

This is an interesting perspective on why we should not be genetically modifying plants and other non-animal organisms. Instead of it being an issues of "safety to human health" it is an issue of recognizing that the modern research on plants shows them as intelligence entities (in their own way) and this kind of research is thus as ethically wrong with plants as it is with animals. (This connects back to the note on [[@gaglianoThusSpokePlant2018#The psychosis of seeing plants as commodities rather than beings - capitalism and colonialism|The psychosis of seeing plants as commodities rather than beings]]

> The development of plant bioengineering, particularly genetically modified (GM) plant research, is an emotionally charged and highly politicized and polarized issue in our society, but the growing plethora of scientific evidence demonstrating that plants are highly sensitive living organisms can offer a detached and unequivocally clear resolution to a much-heated issue. Our current scientific knowledge allows us to appreciate plants as sovereign subjects of their own lives rather than usable objects of ours. This makes the Aristotelian proposition of plants invalid. It also shows that GM plant research has been inaccurately presented as a scientific practice, given that its premise—the use of plants as inert objects, made by humans for entirely human purposes—is unsupported by modern scientific evidence (that plants are living subjects, pursuing their own raison de vivre of being themselves).10 Under these circumstances, the scientific method demands us to rectify our approach by de-objectifying plants and no longer granting scientific legitimacy to GM plant research.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 99)

#### Physicalism belief systems confronted by multidimensional reality of human awareness 

She presents that human awareness is inherently multidimensional, including that of being the physical senses. (even if we are rarely practiced on anything beyond a certain lane of awareness).

This realization for her was confronting to what was her previous belief system, one informed by scientific determinism, that the world and our perception of it was confined to the physical properties of matter.

> as a human being, my natural ability to interact with the world is multidimensional, that the true nature of human awareness is to perceive the multiple facets (or dimensions) of reality all at once, rather than being restricted and totally absorbed within a single one-dimensional aspect of reality at a time. That to perceive and feel the world that I cannot see, touch, smell, or hear, my belief system defining the properties of space and the qualities of time had to collide with and be inevitably overwhelmed by the experience of such multidimensionality, the fabric of existence itself.—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 106)

#### Tobacco's teachings on Grief and Pneumonia 

She presents that tobacco taught her that pneumonia was the physical manifestation of stuck grief, and that tobacco can be used to help heal pneumonia by helping one process that grief. Also, that tobacco becomes a poison because of how it is used and our relationship to its use in our lives, not by basic fact of its physical properties.

> Tobacco carried on explaining why and when he turns into a poison. Then he proceeded to give precise instructions on when and how to prepare him into a medicine to heal pneumonia: “By affecting the proper functioning of the lungs and compromising the amount of oxygen that reaches the blood, pneumonia is, in fact, the physical manifestation of grief, the pain of separation in the emotional body.”—(Gagliano, 2018, p. 117)

>[! warning] A stretch for me
>I definitely feel that the health damaging effects of tobacco are related to our usage and relationship to it and the role it plays in our life rather than the basic properties of the plant itself. However, I am definitely challenged by the proposal that tobacco can help us heal pneumonia. I mean, maybe if it isn't smoked and is used in a healing ceremony, but still, it's a stretch for me.
