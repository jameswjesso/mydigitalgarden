## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This gave a general outline of sound symbolism and its connection to meaning in language, examples, and proposed causes. It concludes that although there is a lot of arbitrary symbolic meaning in language, it is clear that the sounds we make in language not entirely arbitrary.

## Notes

#### Some sound symbolism might be universal across languages


> psychological experiments have shown that sound symbolism in one language can be understood by speakers of other languages, suggesting that some kinds of sound symbolism are universal.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 1)

  
....  
#### Sound symbolism best represented the so-called primitive languages

It's possible that "primitive" languages have greater sound symbolism than modern language, as their development was based on a more direct relationship to the sounds, their meaning, and sensory perception. 

> Perhaps, the impression that sound symbolism is widespread in non-European languages but unimportant in the well-known European languages contributed to its marginal position, as can be judged from statements like Köhler’s7: ‘in primitive languages one finds much evidence for assuming that the names of things and events often originate according to this similarity between their properties in vision or touch, and certain sounds or acoustical wholes. In modern languages, it is true, most of these names have lost much of this character’ (p. 242).—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 2)

>[!tip] Etymology
>I feel like this tickles my curiosity for exploring the etymology of words (largerly inspired by [[Stephen Jenkinson]]). They aren't directly connected, but there is a kind of joy I get in exploring the older (and IMO deeper) meaning in words

#### Not just onomatopoeia, but multi-modal ideophones

Onomatopoeia are words that sound like the sounds they are for, but sound symbolism goes into other sensorial fields. They have connection to other sense beyond sounds, such visual, olfactory, tactile, etc. 

> all languages have onomatopoeic words, words that imitate sounds. Many languages have words that describe how the speaker perceives a situation not only aurally but also with other senses how something looks, smells, tastes, or feels—or describe the speaker’s feelings. They are often constructed syntactically as adverbs, giving a more precise or intense meaning to a verb. This word class, which includes onomatopoeic words,—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 2)

The proposed term to describe these classes of sounds is ideophones

> ideophones. One class contains meanings like ‘small,’ ‘narrow,’ ‘light,’ ‘quick’, and ‘bright’ and the second one meanings like ‘large,’ ‘broad,’ ‘heavy,’ ‘slow’, and ‘dark.’ The first class is associated with high tone, ‘bright’ vowels (i, e, ε) and voiceless consonants, and the second one with low tone, ‘dark’ vowels (u, o, ) and voiced consonants.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 3)

 
....  

#### The seemingly universal associations between perceptual scale and vowel sounds

It has been repeatedly shown that, across many languages, the shape, feel, and tone of certain vowels are more likely to symbolically represent larger or smaller scale, seemingly connected to tone. E.g. *u* sounds, lower frequency being of greater size and *i* sounds of a higher frequency for smaller size.

> The association of the vowel i with ‘small’ and a with ‘large’ has been verified for many languages and has been taken more or less as a language universal.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 4)

....  

> The size scale goes from the vowel u, where both formants are low, to ε where they are both high. Between them there is a general shift of the energy distribution in the vowel spectrum from low to high frequencies. Each step cannot be accounted for by the frequency code, however, and some of them must be conventional. The frequency code is also supported by the fact that the Kammu size scale for onomatopoeic ideophones goes from low- to high-pitched sounds, as if produced by beings of decreasing size.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 5)

#### Sounds and visual perception

The experiment had to do with associated an image to a nonsense sound. 
The sounds were maluma and takete. The shapes were a spiralling round line and a sharp, staccato, jagged line. Takete was regularly associated with jagged line shape and maluma was regularly associated with the rounder line shape

> Many similar experiments42–44 were performed which showed that takete–maluma-like figures were named ‘correctly’ much more often than can be attributed to chance, thus confirming and refining Köhler’s conjecture. Ramachandran and Hubbard45 introduced the names bouba and kiki instead of maluma and takete and Maurer et al.46 showed that children who were just 2½ years old were sensitive to the ‘bouba–kiki effect.’ Ahlner and Zlatev47 investigated the separate effects of the vowels and consonants, and also proposed an explanation for sound symbolism within the framework of cognitive semiotics.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 5)

#### Mouth sounds feeling and tactile perception 

This seems to be in reference to [[@loInvestigationSoundSymbolismContext2017]] and the experiments that showed connection to tactile sensation of a surface and the tactile feeling of the airflow and mouth movements of various consonants. 

> The words consisted of three open syllables and all three consonants of a word were either ‘hard’ (stops: p, t, k, b, d, g) or ‘soft’ (fricatives or sonorants: s, f, h, l, r, w). Some of the word–object pairs were assumed to be sound-symbolically congruent (‘hard’ consonants paired with rectilinear objects and ‘soft’ consonants paired with curvilinear objects), and those with the opposite pairings were incongruent.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 6)

  
....  
#### Sound symbolism and synaesthesia.  
  
They found that people who have synaesthesia were more sensitive to sound symbolism. 

> Bankieris and Simner69 made an experiment to find out if (English-speaking) grapheme-color synesthetes were more sensitive to sound symbolism than non-synesthetes. They let the participants listen to antonym pairs (big–small, bright–dark, down–up, loud–quiet) from ten unfamiliar languages belonging to different language groups, and asked them to guess which member of an antonym pair (e.g., bigsmall) they heard. Both groups performed better than random guessing, but the synesthetes performed better than the control group. They concluded that ‘there are consistent sound-to-meaning pairings across natural languages which can be detected even by those who do not speak that language’ (p. 191), and that ‘synaesthetes’ superior ability in detecting foreign word-meanings suggests that sound symbolism mechanisms might helpfully be understood in terms of the types of cross-modality found heightened in synaesthetes’ (p. 192).—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 9)

  
....  

#### MRI data suggests crossmodal activation for sound symbolism

Evidence seems to suggest that the sounds themselves, the ideophones, also activate the region of the brain associated with the sensory perception they are symbolic of. This connects with [[@kitadaBrainNetworksUnderlying2021]]

> The MRI data ‘provide support for crossmodal activation as a mechanism by which sound symbolism facilitates word-to-meaning mappings. Heightened activation in left superior parietal lobe for sound symbolic relative to non-symbolic words suggests that sound symbolic foreign words engage cross-modal sensory integration processes to a greater extent than non-symbolic words’ (p. 21)—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 9)

  
....  

#### It is clear that not all language is arbitrary in its symbolic meaning

> Even if there is no doubt that arbitrariness is a very important feature of human spoken language, opinions like Saussure’s ‘onomatopoeic words [...] are never organic elements in a linguistic system’ (p. 104) are no longer tenable.—(Svantesson, 2017, p. 10)
