**General Comments on the Book**

Seems to be starting off with a strong focus on the peak experience as being primary in some sense. Also, so far very western academic tradition of conceptualizing these experiences.



##### CORE THEMES/THESIS

“The model I have presented so far is of an entangled, evolving universe that is increasing in complexity and synchronicity (which tends to be a self-organizing process that potentially leads to greater wholeness), which leads to the creation of novel structures and expressions. Psychedelics, from the perspective I have offered, serve as an intermediary between our consciousness and the rest of the cosmos. The connections they manifest and catalyze connect us to the larger holons we are a part of—that of our environment, the Gaian mind, and that of the universe as a whole. Our very consciousness grows out of these larger holons, similar to the way new cells arise within a body. Just as the cells of our body rely on the networks they are a part of in order to exist, so does our mind rely on the larger mind. Our very experience emerges from these larger networks. Consciousness is born out of consciousness. This includes our innate instincts, such as autonomy, communion, transcendence, and dissolution, as well as the deepest part of the unconscious. If this is so, then might our individual psychedelic visions be expressions of a much larger, collective vision of our encompassing and shared minds?” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 277](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 


“**The following statement is an essential reasoning at the core of this book**: changes in consciousness and the brain catalyzed by psilocybin stabilized over time, and as new neurons formed in individuals, and as these individuals later birthed new humans, some these traits of consciousness expansion and brain development were passed on epigenetically.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 164](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 



##### The two Greatest Lessons Psilocybin Has Taught Him: love and learning


> “The greatest lesson this being taught me is that the most important values in existence are love and learning. Love is by far the most important, with learning being a distant second. Everything else—and this cannot be overstated—was so far behind these values that they seemed almost empty. 
> 
> Love is the most intelligent force in the cosmos, always pointing in the right direction. 
> Learning helps us adapt, evolve, and move further in that direction. 
> 
> Both of these, ultimately, move toward unity. If a person orients their life with these two values, they will never have to worry about holding the complexity of everything else. ” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. xiii](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

> “through the lens of these two values allows one to recognize what is important in each instant.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. xiv](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=14&annotation=KJTFQ5WY))

> “From such peak experiences one acquires the sense of their own deeper identity and interconnectedness with everything. Following these states, one is often inspired to create art, transform society, heal others, and orient toward seeing beauty in the world. As evidenced in the experiences described earlier, even just one such direct experience can greatly transform one’s life, with the potential to heal depression and increase vitality and connection.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=38&annotation=IZSUJMKJ))

> “The scientific materialism of modernity cannot make sense of the mystical experiences catalyzed by psilocybin, and the relativism of postmodernism that reduces perspectives to cultural conditioning cannot make sense of the power of psilocybin to mediate similar mystical experiences in people across the globe.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

##### HOLONS

“As Koestler points out, the introduction of the term holon satisfies a genuine need of speaking of something as both a whole and also part. Each holon contains all the quadrants.118 That is to say, each holon has an experience (upper-left/subjective quadrant), a physical body (upper-right/objective), a shared culture with other holons (lower-left/ intersubjective), and a networking structure with other holons (lowerright/interobjective).” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=71&annotation=EL3LYGMS))

“As Wilber points out, all of reality is made up of holons. They create a multidimensional, intersecting web consisting of inherently relational nodes (holons) in a network that gives rise to our evolving and complex existence.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=72&annotation=VRXMPQLR))

“It is important to emphasize that holons are sentient, based on the upper-left quadrant’s assertion that every holon has an interior or a degree of subjectivity, which is the main requirement for consciousness.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=72&annotation=M2E3HCDK))

“Holons are physical-experiential entities that evolve by relating to one another. The structure of a holon is that it is made up of other holons, which are themselves made up of holons. They are systems within systems, each with its own dynamic processes. Through this lens, all of existence, composed of holons within holons, can be seen as a structure composed of beings within beings—a living universe that is both internally and externally interconnected.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=73&annotation=7P4627BN))

“Since humans, in their interior, also contain the interior of a larger holon (according to the assertion of the lower-left/intersubjective quadrant), it should theoretically be possible to experience the larger holon of which one is a part.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=75&annotation=5QTRYRLK))


....

###### Autonomy Instinct and Self-Preservation


“Wilber states that holons display four fundamental capacities: self-preservation (agency), self-adaption (communion), self-transcendence (eros), and self-dissolution (thanatos).128 For clarity’s sake, I will refer to these four traits throughout the book as autonomy, communion, transcendence, and dissolution.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=75&annotation=LYSMCGMM))

“The autonomy instinct is the first motivation in evolution and has us focus on our needs as individuals.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 61](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 

*Is that true? Or is that an assertion based off the distorted interpretations of Darwin, rooted in the dominate worldview?*

“Alfred North Whitehead, in his magnum opus Process and Reality, presents in a logical fashion that feeling is the primary way the universe transmits information. Feeling requires a subject, an experiencer, and as he describes it, feeling is how the whole communicates to each part. He calls this process prehension, which is an instantaneous knowing prior to cognitive reflection.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 61](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

“Because of its necessity, autonomy is the primary instinct most often universally expressed by beings, but it can easily be worked on overdrive at the expense of the other natural instincts” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

“Though this instinct has been and continues to be essential for existence, its overexpression at the expense of the other instincts brings out what we consider to be the worst of human qualities. Greed, pride, jealousy, hubris, cowardice, and selfishness all come out of a wounded or grandiose sense of self and derive from feeling disconnected from others and a larger whole.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

##### The evolution of consciousness with Consciousness itself as a guiding force

Being how extremely unlikely it is that random chance mutation led to not only the creation of life in all the complex forms that we know of but consciousness itself, it makes more sense to hold that perhaps consciousness in some way informed the evolutionary process towards an increasingly complex iteration of itself.

An explanation of human consciousness as arising out a foundation Consciousness pervading the Universe is more logical than it being an accidental consequence of a purely physical reality banging into itself over millions of years

>“Admitting that consciousness pervades the universe, which psychedelics seem to reveal to many explorers, could be seen as the most logical explanation as to why we humans have consciousness to begin with. Otherwise, one is left to conclude that subjectivity arises at some point out of a purely physical universe without reason.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 

> “Instead of claiming that consciousness accidentally arose at some point in the evolutionary process, it is perhaps far more logical, and simpler, to acknowledge that consciousness has been present in the evolutionary process all along.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 


> “The reductionist perspective of evolution leaves us with many anomalies. When one integrates into their understanding the idea that consciousness is found in all aspects of the cosmos, which is a natural conclusion when the universe is perceived through the lens of the metaphor of an organism (a multilayered, living network with self-organizing processes), it is possible to develop a far more coherent, explanatory picture of evolutio” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

“Mammals, with more complex forms of emotional attachment, feel longing, create sexual attraction, and even produce oxytocin to encourage bonding behavior.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=82&annotation=VI28DZHI)) ***Interesting how the sentence structure here suggestion materialism***

##### Once one is safe enough to feel their sense of self (autonomy) the next instinct is towards communion/belonging, which expresses as emotional love. When one is safe enough to feel these met, and is fulfilled by them, the next instinct to move towards transcendence.

“At its highest expression, the emotional quality of the communal instinct is love. Love stands as the most fundamental attractive energy, of moving closer empathically, and bringing wholes together as parts of something more complex. At the rudimentary level it can be seen as the intersubjective empathic connective experience that systemically attracts all the parts of the cosmos together, which is an expression of their greater intersubjective connection that bonds the whole. Communion creates interconnectivity, encouraging creativity to arise out of the complexity. When the conditions are right and one begins to feel safe and experiences a strong sense of self (autonomy) and feels a sufficient sense of love and belonging (communion) another instinct rises from our depths—transcendence.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 67](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=83&annotation=F3FUNUK6))

##### Summary of Wilber quadrant theory for psychedelics. 

“Psychedelics diminish the focus on oneself (upper-left/subjective quadrant) and at the same time enable one to feel more connected to a greater whole by dissolving the default-mode network in the brain (upper-right/objective quadrant), allowing more of the brain to communicate as a whole. Psychologically, psychedelics free the evolutionary energy bound up with autonomy (the sense of self that correlates with the default-mode network) through a death-rebirth process. Experiences of unity are the results of transcendence, of consciously merging with a greater holon (lower-left/intersubjective quadrant), which correlates with the more connected brain states. These unity states can be experiences of merging with one’s environment, the planet, the solar system, or even the entire cosmos (lower-right/interobjective quadrant), and as Whitehead writes: “We must also allow the possibility that we can detect in ourselves direct aspects of the mentalities of higher organisms.”157” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 75](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=91&annotation=I5K4TIQH))

##### Metaphor is what guides our thinking as well as our foundational models of perception (including that of worldview).

“George Lakoff, professor of cognitive science and linguistics at UC Berkeley, and Mark Johnson, professor of liberal arts and sciences at the University of Oregon, argue in Metaphors We Live By that metaphors underlie all paradigms and that they form our primary way of thinking.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=94&annotation=HMYJFVII))

##### A description of Gaia

> “Tyler Volk, a New York University professor of biology and science director of environmental studies, writes in his 2003 book Gaia’s Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth: I consider Gaia the interacting system of life, soil, atmosphere, and ocean. It is the largest level in the nesting of parts within wholes that encompasses—and thus transcends—living beings, a nesting that ranges from the molecules within cells all the way outward to the Gaian system itself. Like the interior of organisms, Gaia contains complex cycles and material transformations driven by biological energy. Indeed, Gaia’s inclusion of life means that from some perspectives, it resembles life. But how Gaia differs from organisms turns out to be its glory. . . . Gaia exists on its own unique level of operating rules, a level surely as complex as that of organisms and therefore worthy of its own science—which Jim Lovelock calls geophysiology.164” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=95&annotation=CW8N8QDG))

##### Various examples intelligence of Mushrooms/Fungi as it is expressed in their wild context and how that relates to Gaia


“In Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World, Paul Stamets, who has researched fungi for forty years, writes about the communication that mycelium fosters: I believe that mycelium is the neurological network of nature. Interlacing mosaics of mycelium infuse habitats with information-sharing membranes. These membranes are aware, react to change, and collectively have the long-term health of the host environment in mind. The mycelium stays in constant molecular communication with its”

“environment, devising diverse enzymatic and chemical responses to complex challenges. These networks not only survive, but sometimes expand to thousands of acres in size, achieving the greatest mass of any individual organism on this planet.179” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=102&annotation=7E8HSYUZ))

“Sheldrake investigates in depth how certain fungi affect animals, especially ants. He concludes that psilocybin likely didn’t evolve as a deterrent for insects and other animals but instead as a lure, changing behavior in ways that benefits the fungus. “This sort of relationship building enacts one of the oldest evolutionary maxims. If the word cyborg—short for ‘cybernetic organism’—describes the fusion between a living organism and a piece of technology, then we, like all other lifeforms, are symborgs, or symbiotic organisms.”19” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 90](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 

([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ***I notice myself feeling like I’ve fallen behind and failing as so much of this book feels similar to mine, which remains unwritten***

“If we are to adopt the integral model’s assertion that all levels of existence contain degrees of consciousness, we can posit that Gaian molecules themselves are regulatory processes of the biosphere. Just as our bodies produce chemicals to bring us toward homeostasis, it is possible that psychedelics grow in the environment to influence behavior through” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=116&annotation=NMYB7NIV))

##### Psychedelics molecules produced by the Gaian system as a part of a protective, evolutionary strategy to compel various species toward behaviours that favour the well-being of ecological systems.

“increasing awareness that will compel species to favor ecological equilibrium. The development of psychedelics in nature may be a protective, and evolutionary, strategy of the Gaian system. This theory is further clarified when we look at it from a living systems perspective, which is a perspective that these Gaian molecules themselves facilitate.221” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

**We are wired to need connection and belonging, and need it for our survival. That connection is communal as much as it is individual, and the rise of the nuclear family system has injured our capacity to both receive and provide the context that allows for that communion/connection to nourish us.**

“This instinctual need for belonging, according to Maslow, arises as soon as we secure our survival, and, as Peter Block points out in Community: The Structure of Belonging, is the foundational quality necessary for sustainable group dynamics. The brain itself evolved to reward this bonding behavior—the more our ancestors physically bonded with members in their tribe, the more their bodies would have released the “love hormone” oxytocin, leading to a feeling of well-being, and again encouraging a feedback loop between their neurochemistry and physical connection.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 116](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=132&annotation=7894XV6H))

“In a modern nuclear family, which is generally separated in its own house, the connection must come from just one father and one mother. In a tribe, this connection comes from likely all the men and likely all the women. Since pathologies tend to develop as a response to unmet innate need, the unavailability for parents to meet a child’s emotional needs (even more so in today’s demanding society) maybe the greatest source of neuroses in our species.2” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 117](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=133&annotation=P2QIVZZP))

##### ADHD genetics as an evolutionary advantage-what drove us to consume psychedelic mushrooms

**The gene that gives rise to ADHD was evolutionary advantageous to our progenitors, and is perhaps is expression in individuals that led those early-ADHDers to explore the novelty psychedelic mushrooms, our use of those mushrooms perhaps being the foundation of how we came to develop/evolve into the manner of consciousness we have now**

> “A gene named DRD4-7R (known as the wanderlust gene) has been found to affect levels of dopamine, our neurotransmitter linked to rewards and pleasure, and correlates to novelty-seeking personality traits.276 Dopamine is quite a fascinating neurotransmitter. In the book The Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity—and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race, Lieberman and Long write: “Mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish all have this chemical inside their brains, but no creature has more of it than a human.”277 Dopamine is the molecule of motivation. The authors go on to say, “In a broad sense, saying something is ‘important’ is another way of saying it’s linked to dopamine. Why? Because among the many things it does, dopamine is an early-warning system for the appearance of anything that can help us survive.”278 The DRD4-7R gene that affects dopamine is twice as likely to be found in the population diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is believed to also have been present in humanity at least as far back as the huntergatherer period of our species.279 The term cognitive “disorder” is highly misleading, however, as this mutation has brought about many evolutionary advantages, including character traits that well served hunter and gatherer societies but often prove difficult for individuals in modern society, as do most types of neurodivergence, or neurological patterning different from that of the average human.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=143&annotation=BJHFJ7EC))

> “A 2019 study of people with ADHD found six core themes of positive traits (cognitive dynamism, courage, energy, humanity, resilience and transcendence),280 and many scientists believe this gene was positively selected to move forward in our evolution.281 These neurodivergent individuals might have been more courageous than others in their tribe and picked up a spear to defend their community when needed. The same individuals are also highly creative, as their minds are constantly seeking for novelty through both ideas and the environment. These individuals would have looked for new sources of food and eventually (and repeatedly) come across the mushroom. Even though the mushroom may have caused highly disorientating experiences, it would have given these individuals the experience of novelty that psilocybin offers, inspiring them to seek out the mushroom again. Because the gene mutation of ADHD affects dopamine production, these individuals actually seek stimulation in the form of novelty just to regulate their mood. People that carried this gene were likely catalysts for human migration and were likely the ones that came up with many of the inventions along the way.282” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=144&annotation=Y2E2GA6J))

##### Offering some suggestions for how and why psilocybin may have had a direct evolutionary impact on our brain and consciousness that led us into developing the manner of consciousness we hold today—neurologically and mentally

> “At higher doses, individuals would also have boundary-dissolving experiences, which Terence McKenna asserts are the most common properties of psychedelic experiences across all substances. As Kotler and Wheal point out, the ability to dissolve individual boundaries is necessary for optimal group coordination. The authors looked into the process of becoming a Navy SEAL and found that what is primarily tested for to become one of the most elite warriors in the country is the ability for members to dissolve their egos enough to work as a larger whole. Instead of being an alpha male, a Navy SEAL has the ability to enable the team to function almost like a single organism. In each moment-to-moment instance, the team may change leaders and then must trust that leader’s direction. Each Navy SEAL must be able to feel and trust the shifts within the group. This is the communion and transcending ability of autonomous individuals becoming a part of a larger whole.The psilocybin mushroom may have enabled similar effects in our ancestors by loosening their ego grips and strengthening bonds within the group.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 132](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=148&annotation=MKFCCFN4))


> “Taking the neurotropic psilocybin at smaller supplemental doses would have integrally, both chemically and through the consciousness-expanding experiences, affected the evolution of human neurophysiology and mental capacities” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 141](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=157&annotation=I2PZKMTW))


> “The neurogenesis and brain hyperconnectivity catalyzed by psilocybin might have also led to the formation of more serotonin receptors so that humans could make more use of the medicine. This explains why our species, whose ancestors might have eaten psilocybin mushrooms throughout a long evolutionary process, have more 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than our primate relatives. Over the course of hundreds of thousands or millions of years, many of these receptor sites integrated into the biology of our species.The development of these receptor sites over the last several million years also explains why humans have a much greater sensitivity to tryptamines in comparison to other animals, including the ability to experience the wide range of consciousness-expanding effects that they catalyze. Over generations, both the brain and consciousness of our species began to expand.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 165](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=181&annotation=7R6MFVAQ))

> “It is true that other mammalian brains were evolving larger in size to previous reptilian ancestors, but what likely caused this growth in size was their ability to connect, to move deeper into communion, with other members of their group. A great portion of our newly evolved human brain is devoted to language and creativity, and it is perhaps these abilities, which helps us to more deeply connect with other people that psilocybin may have catalyzed. As studies have shown, psilocybin increases our experience of empathy, and this could have led to deeper group bonding and therefore survival.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 171](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

##### The experince of accessing information and interacting with other intelligences during psychedelic experiences — DOWNLOADS

> “Horace Beach, in his 1996 dissertation titled “Listening for the Logos: A Study of Reports of Audible Voices at High Doses of Psilocybin,” sampled 128 participants. The data showed that almost 40 percent of the participants that had taken psilocybin in high doses reported experiencing voices. Though his data showed that hearing voices happened to the participants with the use of many different psychedelics, a majority of participants indicated that they first heard the voice with mushrooms.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 157](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) 

...

> “As with many psychedelic experiences, people have described the experience of acquiring information in the psilocybinexpanded states as a kind of download—an entire gestalt of consciousness is instantaneously received like packets of information coming into a personal computer from a networked server.The information can often be intuitively understood at once, perhaps involving a glimpse into what mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead calls prehension.356 Whitehead believed that all parts within the cosmos receive information from the whole through feeling and that this unitive information is felt by organisms before their process of cognition. This information, received and intuitively known in psychedelic states, then has to be cognitively unpacked and processed, integrated over hours or even years, in order to consciously grasp the details and meaning.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 158](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))...

##### LEO ZEFF's 5 Agreements before Psychedelic facilitation

“Zeff developed a protocol during this time and asked all participants to make the following five agreements before each journey: 1) the participant agrees to not leave the space during the journey; 2) the participant agrees to not cause physical harm to themselves, the practitioner, or the environment; 3) the participant agrees that they will not reveal who they worked with or the location of the space without clearance; 4) the participant agrees that there won’t be sexual touching between the practitioner and participant during the journey; and 5) the participant agrees that if the practitioner should tell them to stop a behavior during the session, they will obey.4” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 203](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

##### ME FEATURED!!!

> “Intentional care to create a safe container for a psilocybin journey is especially necessary because these experiences are known for bringing shadow material to the surface. The shadow, a term coined by Carl Jung, refers to the repressed parts of one’s psyche.461 In Decomposing the Shadow: Lessons from the Psilocybin Mushroom, James Jesso writes about the connection between the shadow and the self: Psilocybin mushrooms guide us into a state of increased emotional awareness, and in doing so, are able to bring us into direct encounter with the shadow. During these encounters with the shadow, the mushrooms can guide us into the emotional roots of self where the hard truth of psycho-emotional wounds can be faced directly, released, and healed.462 Jesso draws a metaphorical link between the role fungi play in nature and the effects of psilocybin on the psyche. In nature, fungi are decomposers. They break down the nutrients of bodies that have died to create energy for plants. Without fungi, plants and animals would not exist. Fungi exist at the thresholds of death and birth in the natural world. Jesso states:” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 206](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=222&annotation=Z64KIZ3R))

> “By guiding us into the emotive-psychosynthesis of emotional repression, it decomposes the shadow and unlocks the nutrients contained within it to feed the soil of psychospiritual growth. They take us on a journey through and beyond the death and decay of repression, into the fertile grounds of budding maturity, courage, and confidence. Through breaking down the emotional blockages that hinder us, the psilocybin experience guides us through the shadow and beyond, into the empowerment of personal responsibility and psychospiritual maturity. It helps us learn the ability to surrender ourselves into the honesty of dark emotional experiences without projection, assures us we are capable of going further, and enables us to see the true strength residing within the release of personal blockages. It exposes us to the crucial understanding that the shadow can be one of our greatest spiritual tools once we learn to navigate it. If founded on respect and the intention of healing, a practice with the psilocybin mushroom can bring about a full and successful integration of a fragmented emotional existence into an expression of a whole self.463” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 207](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=223&annotation=NLPRCP2F))

##### Christopher Bache's Philosophical Method for Mapping Psychedelic States


> “He boils down his philosophical method to three basic steps: < Systemically push the boundaries of experience in carefully structured psychedelic sessions. < Make a complete and accurate record of your experience immediately following each session. < Critically analyze your experience, bringing it into dialogue with other fields of knowledge and with the experiences of other psychedelic explorers.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 237](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=253&annotation=B6VJBSAU)) Bache


##### Material Monism Definition

“Material monism is the pre-Socratic belief that the entire world can be fully explained away by reducing it to simple physical elements—like quarks, atoms, or genetics. It is a perspective that fails to include consciousness and complexity as part of the process.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 240](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=256&annotation=YNK29WBD))

##### How patriarchy and capitalism have negatively impacted the world

> “In a world where authoritarian leaders hold the ability to dictate ideas and both economically and intellectually oppress people, autonomy certainly means freedom. Unfortunately, fully empowering individuals without contextualizing them within our larger systemic dynamics is disastrous and creates serious consequences for our world. We are part of a planetary system—and capitalism focuses on the parts at the expense of the whole. Capitalism focuses on individual (autonomous) gain at the expense of other people (communion) and our evolution (transcendence).” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 250](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=266&annotation=54WU33BJ))

> “This also leads to ego inflation. The patriarchal paradigm from which capitalism arises creates a hierarchy. There is a boss with a pyramid of workers under him. Some CEOs in today’s societies make billions, more than they can ever spend in a lifetime. Today the bottom 40 percent of Americans hold only 0.3 percent of the wealth.564 Besides the oppression of people inherent in our economic model, perhaps its greatest effect is environmental devastation. According to Speth, who founded the World Resources Institute, a Washington, DC-based think tank, “We know that environmental deterioration is driven by the economic activity of human beings.”565” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 250](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=266&annotation=RMEMPTWI))

As we are currently seeing in the United States, as the stress of debt builds, people will want to find someone to blame, and this will increase racism, xenophobia, and nationalism as the blame is placed on “outsiders.”” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 258](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=274&annotation=EH7MGWWE))

##### The overlap of realizations of interconnection, digital information systems, and bitcoin/Blockchain on our potential future human and our relationship to nature


> “The networking of all digital information systems, the IoT, can also be seen as the fourth industrial revolution (with automatization being the third). In such a world, information will be shared between platforms, allowing greater coordination between systems, enabling them to work in unison. This allows movement toward a more consciously interconnected, unified world—an external expression of the internal” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 260](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=276&annotation=PBF7UKC7))

> “realizations of a deep interconnected and unified consciousness that can be experienced in psychedelic states. The coming of an electronic and informationally unified world is the integral representation of the right quadrants of what one finds when they look deep into the domains represented by the left quadrants. At the root of the psychedelic insight is a realization of unity, of a supreme interconnectedness, where all information is shared. This would also eventually evolve to manifest itself structurally and physically in our world.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 261](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=277&annotation=AU7XFM3M))

> “Richard Doyle suggests in Darwin’s Pharmacy that a common signature in these rich and varied experiences is what he calls the ecodelic insight: “the sudden and absolute conviction that the psychonaut is involved in a densely interconnected ecosystem for which contemporary tactics of human identity are insufficient.”5” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 262](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=278&annotation=X4JPUD9E))

> “Psychedelics enable people to draw from untapped potentials of creativity. This creativity can be better expressed when individuals have their base needs met, like those presented by Maslow’s hierarchy. Blockchain allows a greater allocation and distribution of resources through a more trusted and resilient network and can be a platform in which to implement universal basic income, freeing individuals from the shackles of focusing on personal survival” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 265](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=281&annotation=PKIWRGRF))

##### The possibilities that await us once we get our personal, social, and institutional systems established to provide long-term security for all peoples

> “Once we collectively establish physical security, which must involve the transformation of our economic systems, then we can further explore the imagination, including mining the deepest riches within psychedelic experiences, and make a quantum leap in human evolution.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 265](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=281&annotation=YCEHM3JD))

##### Don't put *too* much stock in a literal or direct interpretations the visions psychedelic offer us


> “There can be a tendency to put too much stock into one’s visions, whether catalyzed by psychedelics or by one’s imagination, as some kind of universal truth. Psychedelic visions, just as the content that organically arises from one’s unconscious, can be archetypal and be used as a path to explore the collective unconscious, but even so, it is still the individual having them. As much as psychedelics break down the ego, it is not eradicated completely, and post-journey interpretation may run the risk of being viewed through an egoistic lens. Without time to properly integrate the experience, including receiving reflections by a community or integration specialist, one can even temporarily go into a psychotic break with reality.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 288](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=304&annotation=ZN2RVHWW))

##### In order to step into the beauty of what is possible, we need to hold the vision of that beauty in the process

> “The aesthetics, values, and societal organizations we want to see in the world must first be visualized as a projection of a possible future before we can create and embody them in the present.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 289](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8UFS7JKH?page=305&annotation=J6MM2YQ9)) 

> “These medicines may be key to healing many of today’s psychoemotional illnesses, our rapidly expanding epidemics of anxiety and depression that stem from our sense of isolation, stress, and distorted perception of reality and ourselves. Near-end-of-life studies have repeatedly shown that therapeutic use of psilocybin helps patients shed their deepest anxieties, supporting them in facing the unknown with courage

....


> “The greater sense of belonging and unity that can also occur can perhaps galvanize humanity toward becoming harmonious warriors who protect and cherish our Gaian family. As climate change threatens the collapse of ecosystems, and our economic systems continue to become unstable and affect billions of people across the planet, psychedelics can conjure in us the necessary hope and vision to take action instead of drowning in despair. Psychedelics can awaken humanity into standing on the threshold of its greatest realization—the homecoming of its origins and spiritual identity.” ([Khamsehzadeh, 2022, p. 299](zotero://select/library/items/YR272ZUA))

### Possible Interview Questions


Thanks for including me....


....

“The scientific materialism of modernity cannot make sense of the mystical experiences catalyzed by psilocybin, and the relativism of postmodernism that reduces perspectives to cultural conditioning cannot make sense of the power of psilocybin to mediate similar mystical experiences in people across the globe.”

Why do you say this?

Panpsychism?

What about Gaia?

....

Not leaning into materialism, but not shying away from science either...
Molecules and Gaia?

The voice of the mushroom?

....You present a theory for psilocybin's role in human evolutions — historically, presently, and into the future and using integral theory as a basis (leaving that behind though).... Reviving The Stoned Ape in a way....

HIstory.... but what about ADHD?

What about what you see as what psilocybin is offering us now, with respect to our evolution in the face of the consequences of the last 10,000 years—politically, environmentally, economically, etc.




Metahpor?


END WITH...

*The greatest lesson this being taught me is that the most important values in existence are love and learning.*


....


You present a theory for psilocybin's role in human evolutions — historically, presently, and into the future.

Reviving The Stoned Ape in a way....

“**The following statement is an essential reasoning at the core of this book**: changes in consciousness and the brain catalyzed by psilocybin stabilized over time, and as new neurons formed in individuals, and as these individuals later birthed new humans, some these traits of consciousness expansion and brain development were passed on epigenetically.”
