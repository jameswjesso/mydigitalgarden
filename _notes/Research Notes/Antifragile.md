**Antifragile**

#### To be antifragile

To be anti-fragile is to have it so that we (or systems in general) are able to get stronger as a consequence of being shocked in a context wherein the system is able to adapt and learn from that shock. This is different from pure resilience.

#### Objects are not antifragile, but systems are

Objects are unlikely to be able to become antifragile, but systems can be engineered to be.

However, you can't work on being anti-fragile. Instead, you can work on being resilient with a learning mindset. This means that you are not simply able to deal with shock, but also cultivate one's mindset (or system) to be responsive to shock such that it is engaged as a learning experience that alters the system accordingly to afford greater resilience over time.

>[!warning] A note about source of this information
>There is a book about this topic, [**Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. My notes here are not from this book, but instead from a conversation I had with my friend Jordan M, who shared with me his sense of the concept. These notes are from what I gleaned from that conversation. His shared that he felt that the book wasn't very good, even though the concept was excellent and insightful.
