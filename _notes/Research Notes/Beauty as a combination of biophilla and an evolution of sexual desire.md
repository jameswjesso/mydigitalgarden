## Beauty as a combination of biophilla and an evolution of sexual desire

Keltner and Haidt propose that our experience of beauty is an expression of our tendency towards biophillia (our desire to seek connection and closeness with nature and natural things) mixing with an evolution of our sexual desire and attraction impulses.

> We cannot give here an account of what makes something beautiful, although we think it likely that there will be at least two sources of intuitions about beauty, one stemming from ``biophilia'' 0Wilson, 1984), and the other from the evolution of sexual desire and attraction 0Buss, 1994).[^1]
