## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This is an older overview of nature connection and nature relatedness and its various impacts on wellbeing and happiness. The overall theme being is good for us, and a lack of it is harmful to us. It is many a presentation of points from various studies, rather than proposing anything new. The references in this article works as a nice repository of studies showing how nature connection benefits human health.

## Notes

### Nature Relatedness is a mostly stable personality trait that can fluctuate according to context and change through education and experience

NR is mostly stable, but can alter depending on context, eg. increasing using moment in nature, and can be changed through education or experiences (such as with psychedelics, [[@forstmannLifetimeExperienceClassic2017]])

> Nature relatedness is a relatively stable individual difference but may fluctuate momentarily, for example, with exposure to the natural environment, and may be influenced by environmental education.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4270)

  
....  

### Connection to nature can be object or subjective

Connection to nature can be object or subjective. Objective, how close in proximity we actually live to natural environments; subjective, how close we feel ourselves connected to nature itself, a natural environment, or its elements.

> Connection to nature can be considered both objectively and subjectively to describe how people relate to and interact with nature.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4270)

  
....  
### The ecological self

The ecological self is a self-construal that includes the entire Earth, as a whole and all of its interacting elements. That self is not separate from from any aspect of the Earth.

> An ecological sense of self is a self-concept that includes the entire earth. Those who identify with nature feel empathy for other living things, and see themselves as part of, rather than separate from the natural environment.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4270)

  
....  

### Nature relatedness is not just a set of feelings but an understanding of interconnection.

Nature relatedness is an awareness and understanding of the interconnection of life and our place within it, and that all aspects of life are necessary, even those we don't enjoy or are relevant to us.

> Nature relatedness is an understanding of human interconnectedness with all other living things. It is not simply a love for nature, or enjoyment of only the superficially pleasing facets of nature (e.g., sunsets and snowflakes), but rather an awareness and understanding of all aspects of the natural world, even those that are not always aesthetically appealing or useful to humans (e.g., insects, rodents), as part of healthy ecosystems.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4271)

  
....  

### Connection with Nature predicts aspects of well-being, seperate from envrionmental attitudes and social connection


The happiness and wellbeing aspects that come along with nature relatedness are separate from environmental attitudes and even social connection. Such that the happiness elements of nature connection seem to exist independently from that of social connection, and that environmental attitudes aren't necessarily helpful for happiness in general. 


> Connection with nature predicts these various aspects of well-being, controlling for environmental attitudes. In fact, environmental attitudes may not be helpful for happiness; the relationship between nature relatedness and happiness gets stronger when controlling for environmental attitudes (Zelenski & Nisbet, 2012). Controlling for social connections (strong predictors of happiness) also does not remove the relationship between happiness and nature relatedness (Zelenski & Nisbet, 2012). Thus, nature relatedness appears distinct from similar individual differences in predicting well-being, further indicating its unique importance.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4271)

  
....  

### The Biophilia Hypothesis

The Biophillia Hypothesis, proposed by Wilson in 1984, present humans as having an evolutionarily developed drive, a "need to connect with other living things". Also that our immersion in cities and other environments that have limited to no aspects that have not be controlled for by human beings (e.g wild spaces and aspect of non-human life's wildness) is evolutionarily recent and harmful to us. Thus, we need nature for human flourishing. 

Also, Biophobia, would also play a role in the sense that it would help us in our aversion to elements of our environments that would cause of harm (snakes, spiders, etc.)

> Wilson (1984) proposed the concept of biophilia to describe humans’ innate need to connect with other living things. Given that humans began living in cities, separate from nature, relatively recently in terms of our evolutionary development, Kellert and Wilson (1993) argue that we cannot erase the learning and appreciation of biodiversity embedded in our biology.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4271)
....  
> Biophobia (innate fears about harmful or threatening aspects of nature, e.g., spiders, snakes) would also have been an important adaptive advantage for early humans dependent on the natural environment. Thus, strong connections with nature do not require loving all aspects of it.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4271)
....  
> In other words, we need nature and becoming more connected to nature may make us healthier and happier. This also implies that a disconnection from the natural world has negative consequences for human psychological well-being.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4272)

  
....  
### The wellbeing effects of nature don't require wilderness, urban green spaces

The happiness and wellbeing benefits of nature are not contingent on immersion in remote or wild spaces, or long duration of exposure. There are benefits even by simply living in close proximity to green spaces in urban environments, were we are able to observe and appreciate the natural world around us, from trees and plants to the animals that have adapted to live in the city. 

There is even possibility to get the nature connection benefits from short—"fifteen minute"—walks in urban green spaces.

> Nature’s benefits are not limited to remote or wilderness experiences, however. Just living in proximity to green space benefits health and longevity (Mitchell & Popham, 2008). Urban landscapes provide opportunities to observe the plants and animals that have adapted to cities and thrive in the midst of human activities (Ryan, 2005).—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4272)
....  
> Some or all of the benefits of nature may be accessible without venturing far from home or work. Fifteen-minute walks in urban nature settings can increase positive emotions and vitality, attentional capacity, and the ability to reflect on life problems—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4272)

  
....  
### Exercising outdoors promotes better psychological wellbeing than doing so indoors.

People who exercise outside in natural settings are reportedly less depressed and have overall higher sense of wellbeing in comparison those who exercise inside. 

> Those who exercise outdoors, in natural settings (a “green gym”), are less depressed and have better psychological well-being compared to people who exercise indoors (Bodin & Hartig, 2003).—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4272)

  
.... 

### Although greater connection with nature can be painful given ecological destruction, the overall effect of greater connection with nature is net positive on wellbeing 

The reality of the modern world is that humanity is egregious in their pollution, disruption, and destruction of the environment. Great connection to Nature means that we are much more likely to have negative feelings about these things as it increased our concern for Nature. 

However, even with these negative feelings included, the overall effect on our personal wellbeing is still greater than the potentially detrimental effects of increased pain in our concern for its destruction.

*Additionally, as reported by people like John Seed and Sky Otter[^1], sometimes we need the pain of our grief for whats being done to the world in order to better connect ourselves with the beauty it offers (and we are a part of).* 

> It is possible that as people become more aware of environmental problems, they may feel some negative emotions. Particularly for people who have a strong connection with nature, concerns about the degradation of the environment may lead to negative emotions. People who are unsatisfied with local environmental conditions and government policy, for example, are likely to be frustrated and discouraged (Pelletier, Legault, & Tuson, 1996). The links between connectedness and happiness, however, suggest that nature-related people are able to feel concern for the state of the environment but also, simultaneously, feel positive about their individual relationship with nature.—(Nisbet and Zelenski, 2014, p. 4274)
