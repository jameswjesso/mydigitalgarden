# Notes

##### The Single Self Assumption

*“the “Single Self Assumption,” which, in its simplest form, is the idea that: Each of us is a single unified self.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=18&annotation=Y9H8V4K3)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*

##### AWARENESS HEALS: the natural unfolding of attending to and experiencing life through the healthy selves model will naturally help shift you into a healthier disposition

*“More good news: all of this can take place—and often does take place—without any special effort on your part. Remember “Awareness Heals,” the last section of the first chapter? The more aware you become of your own healthy multiplicity, the more often you will naturally and” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=55&annotation=GNF57RBD)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))…“spontaneously shift the way you access and work with your own constellation of selves. This is true for benefits that are personal to you as well as benefits with and for others. Learning how to seamlessly shift into and out of different selves is a key skill that we will touch on many times throughout this book.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=56&annotation=8D7XU7BV)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*  

....

##### The activity of your various selves is perpetually at play inside of you (various movements of qualia of interiority) and outside of your (observable through your actions and behaviour) 

*“Keep in mind: a symphony of selves perpetually plays both within and without you. Inside of you, it can be tuned in to through your thoughts, feelings, and emotions and is often reflected by the sense of harmony, coherence, and selves esteem that you are—or are not—currently experiencing. Outside of you, it can be heard loud and clear in the congruence of your words and actions, the positive or negative habits that you reinforce, and the level of compassion you bring to your interactions with other people (and their selves).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=59&annotation=IPQUMN3R)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*

….

##### The Three Levels Of Benefits of Learning To Work With Selves

“The following list illustrates the three levels:

•Level 1 (Implicit Awareness of Selves): Benefits that you are likely already experiencing to some degree even before you become explicitly familiar with the healthy selves concept

• Level 2 (Some Explicit Awareness of Selves): Benefits that come to you easily and naturally once you have even a little bit of general awareness of the healthy selves worldview

• Level 3 (Explicit Engaged Awareness of Selves): Benefits that flow from a more complete understanding of the healthy selves perspective and for which you might have to work”*([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*

These are the progressive levels of realization and possibility that come from the recognition/awareness of selves. This would make for relevant interview material

....

##### WHY WE LOSE THINGS IMMEDIATELY AFTER PUTTING THEM DOWN
*“The simplest (and we believe correct) explanation is that the part of us that put the thing down is not the part that then has to look for it. We actually, really, truly have no present-time memory of where the object went, because the part of us that put it down is simply no longer present. Similarly, we forgot about the stove burner because the part of us that needed the stove departed or was distracted as we focused elsewhere.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=65&annotation=7ZGQP28P)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*

....

##### BEING IN THE RIGHT MIND AT THE RIGHT TIME = MENTAL HEALTH
*“How is being in the right mind at the right time the equivalent of mental health? Under this conception, when you are with your parents, your child emerges. When you are with your lover, your own lover comes forth. When you are having friends over for dinner, the part of you that enjoys social events, cooking, and taking care of other people will be present.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=66&annotation=YQ5YIG4L)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*

Mental health (as in a lack of dysfunction) is defined as being able to be in/of the contextually appropriate self for each situation. “Bein in the right mind at the right time”.  
I wonder though, how does this apply to our wounded selves? How do we do this without managing away unwelcome selves?  
....  
*“As Celia Ramos puts it, “As a model, it can be said that optimal mental functioning is being able to switch easily and smoothly from sub-personality to sub-personality to gain the most productivity from a situation, plus the ability to access higher levels of problem-solving abilities.”2” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=68&annotation=EILFLRPS)) ([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))*

....

**BEING IN THE RIGHT MIND AT THE RIGHT TIME IS GREAT FOR MENTAL HEALTH—BUT THAT ISNT ALWAYS ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL**
“Mental health is being in the right mind at the right time  
(and doing the right thing).”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=71&annotation=9CVYK84N))

It’s not just about being in the right mind at the right time, but them having our behaviours line up too. (For me, there is still skill building work to be done with respect to the intelligence of each part in its a ailing to read and respond with moves that serve what is “right”, I’m service of the best possible outcome.  
....  
“that still might not be enough; that is, being in the right mind at the right time will not solve insoluble problems, create magic solutions when there are no good alternatives, or replace neces- sary hard work and effort”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=71&annotation=MZ7MDQKN))

**BUT WHAT DOES RIGHT EVEN MEAN?**  
“Definition: Being Pragmatically Right about “Right” What do we mean by the “right” mind? The word right can be used and defined in many ways. To keep things simple, following our pragmatic orientation, we will define the word right as leading to positive practical outcomes. Thus, right means creating a favorable, desirable, or suitable outcome or result. If you are in the right mind at the right time, you should experience it as helping to create positive desired results.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=70&annotation=2S3W4W4L))

My concern about their use of right is mildly softened now that their definition for right has been outlined as something akin to that which leads to or creates ” a to favourable, desirable, or suitable outcome or result”

....

#### Working With Selves

##### SELVES CAN WORK TOGETHER
“In some circumstances more than one of your parts or selves may  
in effect form a coalition that serves as the right mind; that is, two  
(or more) minds or selves working together might function as the right  
mind. We will consider what it means to be working with more than  
one mind, and the value of forming coalitions, in section 3.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=70&annotation=7YCCBW84))

....

##### CALLING IN PARTS THAT ENJOY AND ARE GOOD AT THE THING YOU WANT TO DO
“Please consider the following general principle:  
For more life energy and effectiveness generally, make  
sure that the part of you that is good at and wants to be  
doing something is currently present and in charge. If it is  
not, find a way to consciously call upon or shift into  
that part of you, or simply do something else until  
the right part can and does show up.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=72&annotation=ZZYEP5FL))

This general principle seems helpful: ensure that the part of you that enjoyS and is good at the thing your are going to be doing is what’s alive when doing a thing, find a way to call it in or do something else until it is ready.  
… for writing, this seems helpful and aligned with some of the experiences I have had

....

##### three phases or levels of working with the right mind at the right time formula:
“three phases or levels of working with the right mind at the right time formula:

• Level 1: Without any conscious awareness of the healthy selves worldview or any effort on your part, throughout your life you have probably already navigated and moved yourself into being in the right mind at the right time on many occasions.  
• Level 2: Here, after gaining some awareness of healthy selves— perhaps by working with the “right mind at the right time” idea— you increasingly find yourself considering whether you are (or are not) in the right mind and whether there is anything that you still can or should do about it.  
• Level 3: Having experienced some of the benefits of consciously working with being in the right mind at the right time, you put in additional effort, working toward being in the right mind at the right time as often as is natural and helpful.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))

....

##### MEDITATION IS GOOD FOR INTENTIONAL SELVES SHIFTING
“Meditation, of course, may inherently bring more energy and recharge people on its own merits, but it may also give our selves the opportunity to recalibrate and do whatever is necessary to get the right part(s) of”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 61](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=75&annotation=HHCJFU4B)) “who we are on deck and fully engaged in whatever is coming next.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=76&annotation=LFP49X9I))

....

##### Movement as an essential action for shifting selves  
“An important category to keep in your daily toolkit is movement  
and exercise of any kind. The idea that if you change the physiology, you  
change the psychology showcases the notion that any kind of movement  
of your body—changing positions, movement, exercise, walking, dance,  
yoga, biking—will enable you to better regulate your selves.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=78&annotation=7DNNUYV8))

We can use movement to shift into different selves. Including even positions. Perhaps also posture too. I have long since wondered if part of the mental health benefits of yoga is a change in posture and how our postural disposition influences our mental and affective disposition (acutely and on average)  
(I suppose music as well, but we haven’t gotten to that yet)

....

##### Supplements to shift Selves
“Similarly—and this should go without saying—too much of any  
inebriant will make you more susceptible to unpredictable shifting and  
potential chaos in your constellation of selves. Sometimes, of course, a  
drink or two will enable you to more easily shift into a more confident  
or socially interactive mindframe or part of who you are.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=79&annotation=HQAAH5WR))

I think I use going to my supplements drawer to try and shift into different parts.

....  

**NOTE My thoughts on the the book so far**^([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 67](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))

Ok, into the how chapter and multiple things are coming up.  
First, much of this feels like very basic self care behaviours and actions, nothing new, really. Like protecting yourself from your hangry self from taking over by eating a snack. Or using a nap to help relax and recuperate when certain parts are tired. Not really breaking new ground on the actionable suggestions, just giving a different framework for understanding the efficacy of these actions for having a healthy kind body and life.  
2 - some of how this is being languages so far feels like an elaborate process for putting mangers in charge of the system. Some of it feels like suppressing parts we don’t like in favour of one’s we do, without seeing them for the good intentioned role they have.  
3 - they are speaking about shifting selves and yet there is an invisible and Undiscussed central/conductor self they are attempting to educate on the symphony of selves concept.  
(Perhaps 2 and 3 and 4 will be addressed later on?)  
4 - utility? Recognizing the full breadth of parts available to serve the health and well-being of the system, and employing self energy to utilize that service (while also using self energy to care for wounded parts and support protector parts in not accidentally harming the system). But this is a shift I’m their work with my own ideas, and without that shift I fear the usefulness of this system might backfire.

....

##### AWARENESS HEALS… But what quality of awareness?  
“awareness heals.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=82&annotation=IJ74L5PF))

Awareness heals is an ongoing theme.  
However, I feel what I missing is quality of awareness clarification.

....

#### HOW TO WORK WITH ACTIVATED/UPSET PARTS
“If you can tune in to the part of you  
that is upset and let it know that you take it seriously and will work  
on the problem in the evening, then that part might not become the  
lens that colors everything else that happens throughout your day”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=82&annotation=2B3B7NW8))

In discussing the working with parts that get activated and take root (like a conflict that permeates your whole day afterwards)… compartmentalizing is to communicate with that part in a way that has if feel like it can step back, knowing that you will address its concerns at the appropriate time and it need not being perpetually Active.  
They suggest one way to do this is to write it out or tell someone else about it….  
Again though, the self energy component feels absent in a way that I believe leaves this whole subject to hijacking by managers (as far as they write it out)

....

**Critical take on their perspective on emotional breakdowns**  
“There, it will do what it knows how to  
do best—throw a fit, cry, become incapacitated—regardless of whether  
doing so is appropriate or functional.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=84&annotation=WA3F2FMC))

Further criticism here as those moments of breakdown happen in service to the whole system. They only happen because the system is under so much stress it can no longer hang on. A breakdown into tears at the stress of so,etching, might be a younger part, but good please yes let that part step in an help us release all the built up stress we are holding. Evidently we aren’t managing ourselves well and need a part to step in and release for us and younger parts tend to be much better at crying that older ones.

“HOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE  
CARRIES THE CONCEPT”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=92&annotation=6MPLNE2H))

##### Our inner voice is the internalization of thinking aloud with others as children
“(The Russian developmental psychologist Lev Vygotsky, as described in a RadioLab episode, suggested that thinking itself is dependent upon a child internalizing exterior dialogues with others—from thinking aloud with adults and other children to whispering to himself or herself to totally internalizing those voices.)16”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=99&annotation=SDX5Z5TG))

##### SELF-TALK is best when it isn’t in 1st Person 
“a consensus is arising that engaging in self-talk is  
good for us in terms of reducing stress, increasing focus, and so on.  
Not only is constructive self-talk good for us in a variety of ways,  
but it also seems that people who use the term I in self-talk meant to  
boost confidence or give a competitive advantage do not do as well as  
people who refer to themselves in the second or third person! In”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=102&annotation=T4FNBWYI))

Talking to ourselves can have positive mental health benefits (and all of us do it, starting generally around 5 yo) but it’s positive efficacy is greater when we talk to ourselves in the 3rd person, rather than with I statements.

“Also worth noting is I’m Not There, a biographical musical drama  
focusing on Bob Dylan, with Dylan played by six different actors  
(including Cate Blanchett). Rita Carter states that “Dylan is a self-  
ascribed multiple; by his own description ‘a different person every  
day.’”61 According to movie producer Christine Vachon, “The thing  
about Dylan that’s so fascinating is that he has completely and utterly  
changed his identity time and time again. . . . I think it’s kind of the  
only way to look at him.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 113](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=127&annotation=6E24FUIJ))

I think there is something about letting myself be different people everyday that might support my creative flow. How do I do so with a structure set up for me to succeed at the same time?

“A final example comes from the long-running show Star Trek: The  
Next Generation, which offered sci-fi fans a remarkable example of  
healthy multiplicity. In season 6, episode 20, “The Chase,” Captain Jean-  
Luc Picard’s old professor shows up on the Enterprise with an ancient  
but completely intact ceramic bowl—a “Kurlan naiskos”—that includes a  
set of figurines inside when the top is taken off. After lifting off the lid,  
Picard says, “You mean it’s complete? . . . The Kirlan civilization believed  
that an individual was a community of individuals. Inside of us are many  
voices, each with its own desires, its own style, its own view of the world.””([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 115](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=129&annotation=7B7D2D45))

The idea of parts and mutilplicty of selves is not a modern concept, you present that it is present in various of art and media, literatures, religion and philosophy, and even sewn into the fabric of language itself.  
People can read the book for the detailed account, but can you give us an overview of the history of recognizing multiplicity of selves?

....  
“The gods and goddesses of the Greco-Roman, Hindu, and other  
polytheistic pantheons offer insight into the healthy selves model in at  
least three possible ways:  
• The reflection model: some gods and goddesses are clearly multiple  
in nature, and thereby reflect the existence of selves in all of us.  
• The constituent model: we are all physically composed of the  
essences of multiple gods and goddesses.  
• The participation model: by identifying with, invoking,  
and  embodying multiple gods and goddesses, we participate  
in  and cultivate their qualities and abilities and avoid ignoring  
and thereby angering them.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=141&annotation=889VJH2P))

“Emanuel Swedenborg was an influential eighteenth-century philosopher, scientist, and  
writer. In Arcana Coelestia he wrote, “Perfection and strength come from a harmonious  
gathering of many constituents, which act as one. . . . It is not just one community that  
flows in a given organ or member but many, and . . . there are many individuals in each  
community.”10”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 129](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=143&annotation=QKVLJ7N2))

“Sam Webster, a modern pagan, describes how and why he con- sciously evokes and embodies different deities to access and embody their wisdom: I sort out a deity whose nature is relevant to my life by identifying an arena that is important to me and in which I wish to improve my skills. A deity is in part the embodiment of competence in a given field. The deity also has a distinct character and can be experienced by what I call “looking through the eyes of the deity” or “wearing the form of the deity.” To have this experience, I invoke the deity by its qualities and attributes. I begin with praise and description, calling to mind the image, the sound, the feel of the deity. By focus-”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 130](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=144&annotation=Q6UCT8UH))

##### Monotheistic Religions and The Single Self Assumption

“Where did the pervasive idea of one self—the Single Self Assumption—  
come from? In part, the idea is rooted in the world’s monotheistic  
religious traditions.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 131](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=145&annotation=C923NXY7))

You present that the psychic and cultural doom instil for of monotheism (single god assumption) may be behind the prevalence of the single self assumption, can you unpack that for us?

....  
“If when looking outside of ourselves for religious authority  
we believe in a unitary God, then when we look inside of ourselves we  
will likely search for a single self.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 131](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=145&annotation=UPEJE22X))

The belief of a single, unitary god outside of us implicitly encourages the seeking of a single, unity self within us.

Discussion the history of monotheism, Judaism and Christianity in particular, revealing that it isn’t so much that there is one one god.  
For Jews, it was that there shall be no other gods before jehovah. As in there were many, but only one was allowed to be workshop. Also, there are a number of practices that suggest health coming from the unification and harmonizing of multiplicity as a part of the Jewish faith practices. Even the Kabbalah suggests god as being fractured into multiple parts but existing as a singular whole as well.  
With Christianity, there is the father son and hold ghost, mother Mary, various saints, all to be workshipped as being in alignment with the one god, as that god is expressed through these various forms.  
Seems like the only univocally fended we singular god of modern Christianity is more a result of ignorance and lack of direct study than it is a reflection of the faith itself.

“Elizabeth O’Connor, author of Our Many Selves: A Handbook for Self-Discovery, says that she eventually came to the realization that the entire New Testament could be conceived of in terms of leading us to working with our selves: When I became aware that I was not one, I began to find in poetry and drama allusion to the multiplicity of selves. . . . And then in Scripture, I began to hear the same cry, “My name is Legion!” but in Scripture it was more than solitary utterance here and there. Parables and stories and teachings all concerned the possibility of man attaining to an inner unity. . . . “How long will you go limping with two different opinions?” was more than Elijah’s question. It was the question of the whole New Testament. The early Church was confronting men with their inner division so that there might be a healing of it.29”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=153&annotation=V437PLQA))

“Since monotheism more than  
other paradigms permits adherents to effectively make God in their own  
image, “the God of Western culture is a dissociated executive-self. . . .  
Monotheistic God is a rarefied, abstract, disembodied entity with  
greater awareness, power, and control than lesser beings like man. . . .  
The sole God, the ruling ego of the universe, is a mirroring or projection  
of the dissociated executive-self of the Western psyche.”35”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 142](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=156&annotation=GFDTQ2BP))

**A revealing of the error of my ways—my single self assumptions—within DTS**

“Under the essentialist view, the essence of an individual is, by defi-  
nition, his or her unitary essential self. This root belief—that each indi-  
vidual has a single essential self at his or her core—remained at the core  
of Western philosophy through the classical and modern periods and  
is only now being challenged by postmodern philosophy (often in con-  
junction with feminist and race-related critiques).”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 143](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=157&annotation=TX2IVTR9))

This is a a space for my own revealing, my own true self narrative from dts to be spoken to. Review that work first though.

“Combined with and reinforced by the dominance  
of monotheism, the essentialist view provides a powerful philosophical

##### Morton Prince on Personality in the context of many selves
“In his article “The Problem of  
Personality: How Many Selves Have We?” Prince noted that tradi-  
tional theories of personality are inadequate and incomplete because  
they fail to take into account “normal everyday alterations of char-  
acter.” Prince used the term personality to refer to the sum total of

#### Sigmund Freud removing trauma from his theories to protect the abusers of his clients — this removal helps establish the primacy of the single self assumptions in modern psychology

Sigmund Freud had initially established a theory that the majority of the people he was working with, his patience, and mental illness as a consequence of sexual abuse. And that sexual trauma was resulting in a kind of dissociation and multiple selves kind of thing, fracturing psyching,. But it appears as though it’s likely that he recanted that theory, and came up with an entirely different theory in order to compensate for the denial of such traumas. That denial of traumas being because most of his contemporaries and friends, who are the fathers of the patients he was treating, would would not likely have responded well to be exposed as being sexual abuses of their children.

“What happened to shift Freud (with Breuer) from an early  
acceptance to a later dismissal of the reality of multiplicity?  
Mark  L.  Manning,  Ph.D., and Rana L. Manning, Ph.D., whose  
own multiplicity meta-theory is called “Legion Theory,” give a  
trenchant analysis of Freud’s shift and its consequent impact.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 173](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=187&annotation=NBTMQCUQ))

....  
“The majority of patients in Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud’s book Studies on Hysteria were described as having been victims of sex- ual abuse and up until 1895 Freud considered that the majority of his patients were suffering from the aftermath of sexual abuse in childhood.  
Freud then rejected this idea. There has been a great deal of speculation regarding this decision. Freud’s biographer, Ernest Jones, proposed that given many of the fathers of his patients were part of his own social circle, it would have been difficult for Freud to publicly state that his patients had been sexually abused as children.  
To then explain the symptoms of his patients, in the absence of any real trauma, Freud produced a socially acceptable theory that denied the reality of childhood sexual abuse. Once the memories of sexual abuse reported by personalities were rejected by Freud as not being memories of true events, then the interpretation of the nature of these additional, or “alter” personalities had to change. . . . Despite the many great contributions made by Freud . . . the acceptance of his theory meant that many victims of sexual abuse were not believed and many patients with multiple personalities were to be misdiagnosed. For most of the twentieth-century the reality of many DID patient’s condition was also rejected as their appearance did not fit accepted theory.57”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 174](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=188&annotation=IRGP8F9D))  
....  
“Freud posited his seduction theory in the mid-1890s as the solution to the problem of the origins of hysteria and obsessional neurosis. According to the theory, repressing a memory of early childhood sexual abuse or molestation was the essential cause of hysteri- cal or obsessional symptoms. But within a few years Freud abandoned his theory, con- cluding that the memories were nothing more than imaginary fantasies.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 174](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=188&annotation=HCJZIFMF))

**DOING A VIDEO ABOUT ASSAGIOLI AND WHAT U GOT WRONG IN DTS?**  
“A near-contemporary of Carl Gustav Jung, Assagioli embraced the emerging dynamic psychology of that period and developed it into a multi-level integrative vision of the human being, which he called “psychosynthesis.” In developing both the theory and practice of psychosynthesis, Assagioli contributed to the history of psychology by showing how dynamic and analytical psychology on the one hand and humanistic and transpersonal psychology on the other might be brought into synthesis. He was, with Jung, a major pioneer and exponent of transpersonal psychology.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 182](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=196&annotation=XTNJWQYZ))

*There is The possibility of doing a video about this. Specifically about my use of the self in decomposing the shadow. And how I feel about that kind of language now. I could mention Assagioli as I did mention him in the book as well. I even used one of his terms. I could say something like “and little did I realize when I selected this, but many years later that system would have more place of my work that I even understood it at the time.“*

....  
“Assagioli proposed that each of us has different selves, based on the  
relationship we have with other people, surroundings, groups, etc.;  
that is, roles. We should not identify with any one of these selves.  
The goal is to become aware of the subpersonalities and immerse  
ourselves in each role, so that we can play consciously these vari-  
ous roles. The subpersonalities must be synthesized “into a larger  
organic whole without repressing any of the useful traits.” Assagioli  
touched only briefly on the transitions from one subpersonality to  
another and to their organization. He also saw the value of having  
an observing self that monitors the different subpersonalities”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 183](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=197&annotation=XCDR28PA))

a series of overlapping negative spaces that, taken together, depict a sub-

##### Self Concept in Buddhism - Is the No-Self a Central Self?

> “Buddha himself, in answer to the question of whether a self exists or not, never put forward a definite position so as not to cause new concepts to arise that would be irrelevant and obstructive for spiritual practice. Thus the teaching of no self is to be understood more as a fruitful pedagogical device than as a philosophical doctrine. Nevertheless in the course of the development of the Buddhist system of thought, this came more and more to be an unequivocal denial of the existence of a self. For Buddha and Buddhists, then, the question of whether there was a  single self was mired in pitfalls and best avoided. The key point was to  not end up believing in the reality of one’s own single self, as doing so brought attachment and therefore, inevitably, suffering.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 219](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=233&annotation=MG9DWSJ5))

##### What The Doctrine of NoSelf and Interdependence Suggests about being James

> “If nothing exists with absolute independence, if things are only interdependent, then the whole notion of self changes from some fixed idea into something that is open and elastic, something that ultimately may be only provisional.29”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 219](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=233&annotation=9BJ6BSYL))

The doctrines of noself and interdependence of all things suggests not that there is no James, but there is no individual thing that is James. Not that there is no me, but that me is not an essential, fixed, or constant thing that exists independent of the vast complex of elements, internally and externally, that contribute, compile, and cohere the context with, through, and by which me/james is recognizable. As It is that vast complex that defines context that informs the arising of a sense of me/james, and that context is ever evolving and transforming as time unfolds and events happen within that unfolding of time.

**“mindbody” states as an explanation of where selves arise from**  
“Having moved from “ego states” and “states of consciousness” to “mindbody states,” it is only a short step to substitute the term self for mindbody and arrive at self-states. Thus, in any given moment, our mindbody is constellated as a physiological, neurological, chemical, and hormonal pattern or situation, and a specific self manifests side-by-side with that pattern or situation. Thus, as Thomas Schelling stated, “the human being is not best modeled as a speculative individual but as sev- eral alternates according to the contemporary body chemistry.”7 The last piece we need to bring into our definition is the idea of patterning—that selves are ongoing, long-lived patterns of self-states that recur on a regular basis.\* Selves are self-states, and self-states are recurring patterns of mindbody chemistry, energy, perception, and behavior in a human being.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 236](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=250&annotation=RNYNQG4C))

“Selves them-  
selves are not visible or scientifically measurable from the outside. But  
the recurrent behavior of specific selves is observable and measurable,  
and a self-state’s physiological correlates—body chemistry, neurology,  
and brain activity as seen in brain scans, blood assays, hormonal lev-  
els, and the like)—are material and measurable. Our definition, then,  
provides at least two ways to assess the reality of selves—behavior and  
measurable physical correlates.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 237](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=251&annotation=R84DXS3V))

##### Where Do Selves Come From?

Selves can emerge, develop, from not only negative experiences but positive and novel ones too. The presence of different parts are not always wound reactive. We have many, many parts , some of which are Joyful rooted in positive experiences

“For those who assumed that only mentally ill people had selves, and  
who saw the association between abusive behavior and the creation of  
selves, the idea that most or all selves are formed in this negative man-  
ner made perfect sense. However, it is a very narrow and limited per-  
spective that does not take into account the fact that both happy, joyful  
times as well as simply new, different, or intense experiences can also  
foster the appearance or creation of selves.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 245](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=259&annotation=W3AQ8T3S))  
....  
“It seems likely that nearly any unique, intense, or prolonged experience with others could also give rise to selves; that is, the hallmark of what generates selves is not necessarily the positivity or negativity associated with an experience but the fact that a different part of who we are is being called to respond and react to the circumstances before us. If so, it may also be that unique, intense, or prolonged experiences where one is not with other people—a solitary vision quest, hiding in a city under bom- bardment, or being a shut-in—could also give rise to selves.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 246](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=260&annotation=8ZUM7T2E))

**DEEP LEARNING!**  
“What we invite you to do, then, is to get in touch with the subjectiv-  
ity of more than one of your own selves, either one you have experienced  
recently or one from longer ago. Later, even if you cannot remember just  
what it was like to be in any other particular self, you may still be able  
to hold on to the feeling that this is indeed what actually happened, and  
that from inside that self, things looked and felt substantially different”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 263](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=277&annotation=4F782F74))

##### Flocking as an explanatory metaphor for emergent leadership within a no-central-self system

>“Frank Heppner determined that  “the flock maintained a state of dynamic equilibrium, with different  birds briefly finding themselves at the flock’s leading edge at different  times.””([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 290](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=304&annotation=44JK6RLA))

This premise of flocks and flocking i. The best metaphor offered so far in understanding the capacity of the system to operate without a central organizing self. Although I am still uncertain/confused about who is the self or selves that is doing the switching and/or centering.

....

##### Communication With Parts (rather than just talking) Is Key

“The real key here is not talking per se, but communication. You  
might, for example, have a self that does not like to talk much or that  
is very young or otherwise cannot talk. This self will still be able to  
communicate in other ways: through body language, nonverbal and  
subverbal utterances and exclamations, and other ways of expressing or  
signaling feelings, visceral sensations, or recalled sense memories.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 297](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=311&annotation=Z6M8LYRJ))

Talking to selves may actually be talking, however it is less about the talking and more about the communication. And communication, the sharing of meaning, can unfold in many different ways, e.g. body language, feelings,recalled sense memories etc

....

##### [[No Bad Parts]] 
“But for selves talk or dialogue to be effective, a genuine conversation  
must occur. This requires acknowledging and accepting that the selves  
that are involved are real and have valuable things to communicate and  
perspectives that must be taken seriously.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 299](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=313&annotation=WIL9D7RC))

No bad parts… all parts are in service to the your well-being, but only as far as they can see, within the context and confines of their capacity.

## Wondering About Their Misunderstandings about IFS/Self Energy

....  
“Another potentially more serious problem with any super-self ori-  
ented system is that by elevating a single self in this way, the reality and  
needs of other selves are likely to be questioned or even ignored. This  
can sometimes lead to the highly questionable practice of forced merg-  
ing or integration (death) of selves.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 278](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=292&annotation=59JUPJLY))

“that while there is a focus on a spiritual Self—a kind of  
super-self—that Self is not the same as the personalities or selves  
otherwise discussed, and therefore, even if a kind of “unification”  
under the supreme spiritual Self is the goal, this may be quite dif-  
ferent than dubious attempts at forced integration or unification  
of selves, which we will return to later”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 324](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=338&annotation=EUEHBC8Y))

“For example, the 2017 book Schwartz wrote with Richard Falconer,  
Many Minds, One Self, covers some of the same cultural, psychological,  
and neurological territory that we do but concludes with such a strong

Schwartz and Falconer establish the existence of many minds in all of  
us, they then tell us that the way to work with those minds is to develop  
a single essential spiritual Self.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 335](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=349&annotation=RMKZJK57))

“As suggested earlier in the book, cohesiveness can be defined  
in terms of whether a human being is functioning and presenting in an

is substantially based on:  
1\. how congruent their words, actions, and overall behaviors are with  
their previous words, actions, intentions, and plans;  
2\. how coherent—how understandable and sensible—they are in their  
interactions, communications, and relationships with others; and  
3\. how compassionate—how kind, patient, and understanding—they  
are with their own selves and the selves of others.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 357](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=371&annotation=5J39L5F3))

**Ritualistically calling in different selves for different needs**  
“different selves have the ability to bring to the fore different qualities, characteristics, and talents.

**A self that feels no pain because of another self that absorbs it? For sleep?**  
“I’m pretty sure that I developed an alter who was more or less impervious to pain—someone who was simply able to erase both the pain itself and any lasting memory of it. I mean, I’d feel the discomfort at first, but then something else would kick in, the Erase would kick in and I was able to go again at full speed. Unlike before, with my alters who helped me with my fear of the dark or to endure the teasing, when it came to dealing with pain, my switching, for lack of a better word, was closer to a truly conscious effort. I was aware that I was in pain, and I’d say to myself, “Okay. It’s time to go. We’ve got to go. This isn’t going to stop us. Push. Just push on through it.” And I would.31”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=51&annotation=D3PZD6FU))

“Whether we are talking about alcoholism, tobacco use, drug abuse, or overeating (or its opposite, anorexia), or other addictions like gambling, compulsive shopping, hoarding, or porn addiction, the first step is to recognize that there is a distinct part of you that initiates, engages in, and prioritizes this behavior.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=53&annotation=KUJVYINW))

The part that enjoys porn is the parts that loves stimulation of all forms… mixing with the part that desires companionship. (It’s ok because she isn’t here and won’t be for a while)

....

**Do a parts/selves map?**  
“Those who wish to diagram or constellate the big picture of their own  
personal system of selves will likely get different results by doing so  
at different times and by using different methods.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 255](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=269&annotation=6XGIR8D9))

It might be interesting to map my parts thus far….

**The writer in relationship with the mushroom as a role player…. How do I cultivate this part again?**

....

**What most likely leads to infidelity**  
“Esther Perel, author of Mating in Captivity (2007) and The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity (2017): “Affairs [can be] a form of self-discovery, a quest for a new (or lost) identity. For these seekers, infidelity is less likely to be a symptom of a problem, and more likely an expansive experience that involves growth, exploration, and transformation. . . . Sometimes when we seek the gaze of another, it’s not our partner we are turning away from, but the person we have become. We are not looking for another”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 265](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=279&annotation=4YJR3G73)) ... “lover so much as another version of ourselves. . . . So often, the most intoxicating ‘other’ that people discover in an affair is not a new part- ner; it’s a new self.”53”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 266](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=280&annotation=NUGH4K4Q))

How might my perception of Alysha (disappointed and irritated) perhaps led her to be allured to someone who helps her feel a self she appreciates more?

....

**Something to bring up in Therapy?**  
“There is no question that in different selves we have more or less  
energy and social drive. We also have more or less ability to concen-  
trate, tolerate hunger or physical discomfort, move into and execute our  
professional and artistic capacities, and succeed at sustained creative  
endeavors. It really should not be such a big surprise, then, when even  
discrete physical measurements differ significantly depending on which  
of our selves is present.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 267](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=281&annotation=GNEUG5K5))

A piece to bring up in therapy, the part that just doesn’t want to care and wants to give up.  
....

**Getting into your writer self!**

“For example, I dislike writing. Intensely! . . . In order to write, I  
have to tap into the part of myself who is a cook. I am a very good  
cook. I have no blocks whatsoever, full of galloping chutzpah. I get  
into my cook self to be able to write, to stir the mélange of ideas,  
to add a little pepper sauce, if I need something really vital, add the  
herbs of energy there, and so as a cook I can write. But as Jean I  
cannot write.14”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 330](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=344&annotation=9MXIL8FS))

...

**With Respect To Relating With Alysha**

“Johnson’s focus on appreciating each self for what and how they  
contribute may also be the most effective way to treat someone with  
an addiction. Instead of excoriating an addicted self, a better first step  
may be to find a way to acknowledge and even appreciate it”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 300](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=314&annotation=WWRWQ974))

This is something that would’ve served me well last night with Alysha. Given that I was certain that her association/aloofness is a kind of addiction she has, an addiction to kind of defence mechanism, or at least it seems to have impact of somebody with an addiction, that speaking with kindness might’ve been a better approach than speaking with frustrated fearful anger

....  
“A final potential “disadvantage” is that you may find yourself unable to get or stay righteously angry at other people’s selves as well as your own selves when they act in ways that are inconsistent or erratic, or even when they say or do things that you have explicitly gone over with them as being “not okay.” Yes, part of the other person, or part of you, may have agreed to no longer do the offending behavior, but that may not be the self that is currently in charge.\* The key here is to remember that you have one or more selves that can be more patient, more forgiving, and more willing to make peace than some of your other selves. If you can access a more forgiving and compassionate self, then everything will usually be better for everyone.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=57&annotation=84BRS48C))

This definitely relates to how I experience Alysha’s myopic behaviour with respect to me being forgotten

....

**Great Advice From Dan Milman**  
“As you experience the reality  
of the selves in your own being, consider whether doing so makes your  
life work better. As Dan Millman has suggested, ask yourself: “‘What  
would the strongest, bravest, most loving part of my personality do  
now?’ And then do it. Do it with all your heart. And do it now.”59”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 268](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=282&annotation=5WHG4JVT))

## PODCAST QUESTIONS

**The Single Self Assumption**

I want to get into the healthy selves model and the nuances of this, but I think it makes sense to contextualize that discussion by first exploring what you call The Single Self Assumption…..

Can you give us a rundown of The Single Self Assumption and why the deconstruction of which was such a primary theme in the book?

**So if we don’t have a single self, then what is the nature of our mind?**

Give us an outline of what you present in the book as **the healthy selves model**

What are selves?

How real are they?

**Exploring the Dominance of The Single Self assumption**

Before getting into how to work with selves, I would like to first take some time to explore The Single Self Assumption and its rise to dominance a bit more.

There is a large amount of history offered with respect to the presence of multiple selves concept in psychology. And I’d like to not explore that in this interview, as it seems like it would substantially dominate the majority of our time. And I will leave it to listener to follow up in reading your book, as the depth and thoroughness presented in the book could not even remotely be matched in the timeframe that we have available to us.

I would like however to briefly explore the impact Sigmund Freud because that history is something I think a lot of people should have a sense of, especially being that the premise of having an EGO is so common place in the cultural rhetoric on the nature of our minds….

From what I understood fro your book, Freud had a huge impact on the reestablishment of the single self assumption out of a reasonably solid foundation of multiple selves on behalf of a number of his contemporaries at the time, and that this reestablishment of the single-self assumption as potential roots in him protecting the abusers of his patients.

Can you give us the story here?


**Let’s turn to Jung (post Freud)**

You propose jung as having a many selves kind of basis with his conception of autonomous complexes. Can you flush this out a bit more? Additionally you suggest that he still promoted the single self assumption can you flush that out as well please.

**Before we get to “working with selves”, I want to shortly explore the Single Self Assumption and relgion, starting with Buddhism**

Can you give us a short run down of how Buddhism and no-self/interdependence concept relates and contrasts with both the single self assumption and the healthy selves model?

**Final religion question, SSS and Monotheism**

“Where did the pervasive idea of one self—the Single Self Assumption—  
come from? In part, the idea is rooted in the world’s monotheistic  
religious traditions.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 131](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=145&annotation=C923NXY7))

You present that the psychic and cultural dominance of monotheism (single god assumption) may be behind the prevalence of the single self assumption, can you unpack that for us?

**Working With Healthy Selves**

How do we work with selves according to the healthy selves model and how does this differ from other forms of parts work?

**Parts work without a central self?**

Flocking….

**What about a “Super-Self”?**

You explicitly discuss how trying to forge a kind of super self captain is subject with failure, and I’m curious if you can expand on this? Especially given that throughout this entire book there is a kind of call being made to add awareness within the individual person that manages and switches between different selves. The cultivator doesn’t call today recognizes switches etc. It seems like this entire book happens to be written to his central organizing self, and yet there is the explicit mention of not making a super self

**How is “centering” different? Is the self that centers not a central self? Why**

**Integrating selves against Will?**

“to integrate a self against its will is not a benign act.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=23&annotation=QK9BLRBC))

What does this mean?

**This brings us to psychedelics…..**

Where do you see psychedelics in all of this? In therapy, sure, but in general too?

Is there anything in particular about the psychedelic experience that support a transition away from the single self assumption and/or towards the healthy selves model?

How does the experience of oneness calculate into the healthy selves model? Is the universe one big central super self?

What is your take on the primacy of “ego” as a language for understanding what it is that is being reduced/is dying to create the opening to the psychedelic experiences, and oneness for example?

What of entities, spirits, and other experiences such as this? Are these all just different selves?

What impact does the experience of oneness offer us with respect to understanding these other intelligence? If I can be a functioning whole with many selves independent but interrelated, and life and reality is a kind of functional whole too, would it not be logical to propose that there are many “selves” independent but interrelated in that larger whole that would not be of “me”?

**THE HEALTH NEW NORMAL**

....  
“THE HEALTHY NEW NORMAL  
BEYOND THE SINGLE SELF ASSUMPTION”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 359](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=373&annotation=WNNCD972))

You end your book with presenting the possibilty of a healthy new normal beyond the single self assumption. What do you mean by this and what benefits do you see this offering the individual, human civilization, and perhaps life on this planet as a whole?

Why do you feel this healthy selves model serves us to adopt?

## Potential OTHER Podcast Questions

....  
“While chapter 1 focused on the “what” (healthy selves awareness) and chapter 2 on the “why” (likely potential benefits), this chapter suggests a simple way of working with the “how.””([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=66&annotation=LKGDLIXW))

What why and how as baseline questions

....  
“To  
that end, we will set out three phases of using and benefiting from the  
right mind phrase, along with a couple of specific ways that some people  
successfully use it.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=71&annotation=M867W4KZ))

QuEsTION …. 3 phases, ways,

**NOTE**^([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 143](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))

....  
“We have often said that we do not have a formal theory. We do, how-  
ever, have three premises and a few definitions. But we hold these premises  
and definitions very lightly, and only within a much larger context. This  
context includes the wide variety of explanations, facts, surmises, theories,  
speculations, and other approaches to selves discussed in this chapter.”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 231](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=245&annotation=JF2IKSNU))

What are these three premises?  
(Check this chapter for the list of questions just about this highlighted quote)

....  
“What are selves?  
• Where (from what source) do they arise?  
• When are selves created?  
• What types of selves are there?  
• Are selves real?  
• Why do we have selves?”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 232](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=246&annotation=TPL64X53))

**NOTE**^([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 259](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK))

What of the central organizing self that orchestrates this whole switching and cultivating process?

....  
“Perhaps, then, the ongoing activity of the default mode network—  
where we are when our current up-front mind or self is not focused on  
anything in particular—at least in part represents the neuroanatomical  
location of where our different selves reside and operate; that is, where  
they think, feel, remember, and otherwise exist”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 244](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=258&annotation=W7JHUIBP))

You propose that the functioning of the default mode network can bring out different selves, what is your take on the selves that’s emerge during the down regulation of the dmn during psilocybin experiences?

“HOW REAL ARE SELVES?”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 260](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=274&annotation=89TSYI4Y))

Or is this jut a pragmatic fiction?

....  
“Just how “real” are selves? We will consider four perspectives: • a behavioral perspective • a physiological perspective • a subjective perspective • a pragmatic perspective”([Fadiman and Gruber, 2020, p. 260](zotero://select/library/items/2N6L5LIK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GR2CFING?page=274&annotation=IH98LUS6))
