## Summary

They explore how there seems to be a general dismissal of low-level sensory effects of psychedelics when studying the mechanisms behind the experiences. And that there are two main theories, 

that psychedelic relax top down modelling through action on the DMN and the effects arise from there; 

> One of the most prominent existing models, the RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics [REBUS] model, suggests that the relaxation of top-down expectations (“high-level priors” in the language of predictive coding) encoded by high-level regions and networks, in particular the Default Mode Network [DMN], may be the defining characteristic of psychedelic brain dynamics and subjective experience

- and that they decrease sensory gating through action on the thalamus and claustrum  and that the other effects seem to stem from there

 > "Complementary or alternative models have focused on subcortical structures such as the thalamus and the claustrum, which are proposed to have roles of gating sensory inputs, or orchestrating brain dynamics, respectively"
 
However, the authors suggest that neither of these theories have parsimonious conclusion for the source of the psychedelic effects, and that both seem to ignore what low-level sensory experiences might have to offer to the experience, both in their root cause, consequence of psychology, and in the therapeutic use.

The authors propose that this low-level sensory experiences might be the result of a visual manifestation of direct effects on visual neurons, and that this effect on the neurons might be a primary driver of the other two observed sets of brain dynamics, top down and bottom up, respectively.

##### Psychedelic result in a distruption of top-down modelling capacity and increase bottom up sensory exposure

Another study where this is mentioned.... classical psychedelic reduce top-down capacity to comprehend perceptual elements and increase bottom-up sensory input.

> While there is no universal agreement, perhaps one of the few widely accepted characterizations of the psychedelic state is as one of reduced top-down cognitive control, and increased bottom-up influence of sensory information.

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 1)

...

##### Typical psychedelic visuals, like breathing walls, might be a manifestation of direct molecular effects of psychedelic on neurons of the visual cortex

low-level sensory changes such as the experience of breathing walls, and other visual elements of psychedelics might not be caused by relaxed top down modelling nor bottom up changes in sensory gating, but by a domain specific change in the osculatory dynamics of the visual cortex due to the impact of psychedelic on the 5ht2a receptors of that cortex. And that this change is more at the root of the latter two processes than the other way around

> a parsimonious bottom-up account of the ‘breathing walls’ phenomenon could be provided by a psychedelic-induced excitation of specific harmonic-temporal oscillations in visual areas, which would be experienced as illusory motion, and could be interpreted by high-level systems as a ‘breathing’ of sorts when superimposed to the visual input of inanimate objects such as walls.

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 3)

...

##### Neither the top down or the bottom up theories have the complete picture

> Hence, while we share with the proponents of the CSTC model the proposal for a role of low-level sensory dimensions in causally influencing high-level effects, we suggest that this model, much like REBUS, could benefit by integrating domain-specific aspects of psychedelic phenomenology, and corresponding low-level cortical dynamics.

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 3)

...

> The key point here is that bottom-up effects of psychedelics are unlikely to be entirely byproducts of top-down processes, but rather might be caused by a direct involvement of psychedelics in low-level sensory areas; and that the two are likely to exist in a dialogical interplay, where low-level processes also play a causally relevant role in influencing high-level effects.

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 4)

##### How high-level-abstract psychedelic visual experiences alter the brain and perception systems post-experience

Wondering about what impact experiences of high doses of psychedelics and the entirely non- naturalistic, abstract visual experiences they occasion will do the the neural and schematic systems that interpret visual stimuli into perception, given that those dynamics and schema are build entirely on naturalistic stimuli  
  
[[Psychedelic visions' effect on visual perception through single trial learning - HPPD|a wondering on this wondering]]

> What could one expect to be the impact on of an extremely intense, novel, unpredictable sensory experience on preexisting high-level priors? More specifically, what about an experience of immersive visual content of highly non-naturalistic (abstract) character, not relayed by subcortical structures, but rather instantiated directly at the cortical level,3 such as is experienced during a high-dose psychedelic state? Given that high-level priors are built via a lifetime of naturalistic sensory stimuli, we predict such an experience would lead to a profound alteration of the brain’s model of what visual input is ‘supposed to look like’; and given the particularly significant impact of visual input for the development, maintenance, and revision of these constructs, of what the world is; as a consequence, such an experience might trigger a revision of beliefs even at more abstract levels, bordering into the metaphysical, as is indeed the case for psychedelics (

##### Top down and bottom up blend and meaning is attempted to be made in a neural context when meaning is a slippery beast

> In other words, we suggest that top-down and bottom-up processes amalgamate to produce the complexity and variety of psychedelic experience.

##### The proposition that sensory/visual experiences play an important role the therapeutic potential of psychedelics

The proposition that sensory/visual experiences play an important role the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, and that this role is an important one and should not be as generally disregarded as much of the research has seemed to do

> In sum, we contend that the constellation of therapeutic processes set in motion by psychedelics are unlikely to rely exclusively on mechanisms independent of subjective experience, or on nonspecific top-down processes, such as an increased attribution of meaning or relaxed priors. We argue that the sensory phenomena elicited by psychedelics are far from being ‘epiphenomenal byproducts’ and rather may constitute, if not the engine, at least a valuable propellant for psychedelic therapeutics. As an important caveat, we note that this is not to say that any and all sensory phenomena elicited by psychedelics will be relevant for therapeutic outcomes; nor that high-level processes do not play a crucial role, particularly at the stages of interpretation and integration of experience; our argument here is only that the available evidence does not warrant disregarding all sensory phenomena elicited by psychedelics, in particular visual hallucinations, as irrelevant for therapeutic outcomes. Specifically, we have hypothesised that simple hallucinations may contribute to psychedelic therapeutics by eliciting the sense of awe, and by triggering changes in the sense of reality and sense of self, in turn relaxing the normal bounds on these constructs; while complex hallucinations may allow the vivid revisitation of personally relevant sensory content, which may be reappraised during a critical period of shifted perspective (Lepow et al., 2021); both contributing significantly to the revision of high-level beliefs and narratives of self and world, bordering into the metaphysical (Timmermann et al., 2021).

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 6)

...
##### Visual cortex changes via psychedelic have far reaching effects throughout the brain

Changes to visual cortex functioning, as well as an increased influence of visual cortex stimulation on overall brain dynamics/reality modelling has a significant impact on ones psychedelic experience.

> the available findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neural dynamics in sensory cortices during the psychedelic experience might exert far-ranging effects throughout the brain.

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 7)

...

##### Relaxation of DMN via psychedelics an indirect effect of molecular changes in sensory processing

The proposition here is that domain specific changes in sensory processing in the visual cortex might "casually influence" the "relaxation" of the DMN and that the reduction of DMN in psychedelics states might not be primarily a direct result of molecular effect on the DMN itself

> psychedelic-induced low-level sensory activity may causally contribute to the DMN deactivation, and related alterations of the sense of self; it is perhaps then not surprising to note that sensory overload has been employed in ancient and modern routes to loss of self, from shamanic traditions to rave parties. Furthermore, interestingly, recent empirical work on large-scale fMRI datasets has revealed a visual-spatial organisation of the DMN (Szinte and Knapen, 2020); and recent theoretical work has provided hypotheses of ways in which low-level sensory experience could affect high-level constructs like the sense of self, from an information-theoretic perspective (Luppi et al., 2021b ). Together, these findings suggest that future models could benefit from taking into account alterations in low-level sensory areas when attempting to describe psychedelic effects on global brain dynamics and high-level dimensions of experience.

(Aqil and Roseman, 2023, p. 7)

...

##### Conclusion

> We conclude that integrating the domain-specific and nonspecific aspects of psychedelic dynamics, as well as unraveling causal connections between seemingly unrelated dimensions of experience, is a necessary step to further understand how these remarkable compounds effect both acute and long-term therapeutic (or possibly harmful) changes in the human brain.
