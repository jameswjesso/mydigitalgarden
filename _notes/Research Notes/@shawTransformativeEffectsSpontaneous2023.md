## Personal Summary

## Notes

#### Findings in this paper suggest and OBE has effect on individual 

Findings in this paper suggest and OBE has incredible psychological benefits on the individual who experienced it, representing such a dramatic shift that authors referred to it as "a quantum change experiences" 

> The findings suggest that the OBE could be categorized as a quantum change experience, with potential psychological benefits to the experiencer.—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 1)

#### An OBE is... 

An OBE or out of body experience is an phenomenon where one expeirences themselves and the world from the perspective of being outside their physical body

> The out of body experience (OBE), during which an individual experiences the world from a location seemingly outside of the physical body, is a cross-cultural phenomenon that has been reported for centuries (Metzinger, 2005).—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 1)

#### Belief in and perspective on OBE is very common and consistent accross cultures.

Belief in and perspective on OBE is very common and consistent accross cultures.

> One study concluded that 95% of 70 cultures surveyed believed in the phenomenon, and perspectives on it were highly uniform between cultures—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 1)

#### Th most agreed up phenomenology of OBE is a feeling of being serpated from one's body

Th most agreed up phenomenology of OBE is a feeling of being serpated from ones body, usually with some kind of energtic or vibration sensation during the shfiting to a a kind of second body, sometimes occupiying this second "sutble" or double body, orther times traveling to various locations as a kind of pure awareness or point of perception

> hese include: a noticeable feeling of “separation” from the body including the sensation of being outside it and observing it from a distance, sensations of vibrations or energetic phenomena during “separation” and self-agency shifts to a “second body” or travels as a moving awareness to different locations, and time and space distortion (Blackmore, 1982,2017 ;Bünning & Blanke, 2005;Sellers, 2018 ). Following this transitory experience, the person appears to function away from the physical body in what has been described as a subtle, second or double body, or as a point of perception—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 2)

#### The three different circumstances that an OBE is known to be triggerd

Spontaneously by extreme cirucmstances, physical or psychological. Spontaneously without any intent of involvment on the part of the eperiencer, either withouth any notable trigger otehr than being in a sate like hynogogia or hypnopompia, or in bring triggered by a substance. Occuring by intention triggered by some kind of practice or exerciese: meditation, dreamwork, hyposis

> OBEs are known to be triggered in three different circumstances.—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 2)

  
....  

#### Data on OBE in this study does not includes those had during intentional or drug-induced circumstances

These results are from people who did not have OBE as a part of psychedelic experiences or intentional practices due to the potential influence of the pscyhedelics or the mindset behind those practices had on their transformational outcome.

> Participants with experiences via drugs or NDE were not considered due to the external influence of substances or extreme circumstances such as cardiac arrest, while drugs such as psychedelics can elicit mystical-type experiences, the aftereffects of which may overlap with the OBE. Similarly, people with self-induced experiences were not chosen due to underlying intentionality that may influence the nature of the event and the level of impact.—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 4)

  
....  

#### The 8 transformational themes observed

> Eight superordinate themes were identified in all transcripts: (a) motivational catalyst; (b) decreased fear of death; (c) increased inner peace; (d) new life perspective; (e) greater self-awareness; (f) sense of individuality; (g) reevaluated relationships, and (h) affirmed or new spiritual beliefs.—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 5)

#### The suggesiton is that the change in ones relationship to death as a conseqeunce of the OBE is a significant contirbutor to their postive transformational effect,

The suggesiton is that the change in ones relationship to death as a conseqeunce of the OBE is a significant contirbutor to their postive transformational effect, and that this change is likely the result of the alteration in ones sense of body shifting from a finite physical one to something more expansive, and perhaps thus includes the continuation of consciousness beyond the body and thus beyond death.

> Whilst it isn’t possible to pinpoint precisely correlated changes, the psychological effects of switching identification from a limited, finite body to a broader and more expansive sense of self appears to have catalyzed changes in attitudes and behavior.—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 9)

#### Increasing one's sense of connection from that of disconnection has a postive impact on mental health recovery

> A shift from a state of disconnectedness to one of greater connectedness has been proposed as a factor underlying the recovery of mental health (Leamy et al., 2011),—(Shaw et al., 2023, p. 10)
