### Summary

Experiences of awe, through diminishing the sense of self, induce greater prosocial behaviour including generosity and ethical decision making

##### Experiences of Awe diminish/make smaller ones sense of self, allowing for inclusion in social/collective identity

Experiences of awe make the sense of self smaller, which allows for that sense of self to be integrated into a larger context, like the collective identity of social as a social group or movement or a religious framework

> Experiences of awe, this reasoning holds, enable individuals to be effective members of social collectives, through shifts in attention to the self and through prosocial behavior.

(Piff et al., p. 883)

...

##### Triggering of need for cognitive closure through awe can potential led people to finding signal in randomness

> Some experiences of awe may also trigger a sense of uncertainty and motivate people to seek out orderâ€”for example, by perceiving intentionality in randomness

(Piff et al., p. 884)

...

##### People are more likely to be generous when they are plants in the room than when there are not

> participants behaved more generously when in a room with plants as opposed to a plant-free room (Weinstein et al., 2009).

(Piff et al., p. 885)

...

##### Link between and nature-connection in small self and prosocial behaviour

The basis of their hypothesis that awe causes prosocial behaviour as a result of the alteration of the self concept into a smaller sense but a larger context is base don both the research done with awe, but also with nature relatedness (inferring perhaps that they are related mechanisms given that nature can induce awe)

...

##### Awe does create a smaller sense of self

> The awe condition led to greater small self ratings than did the amusement or neutral conditions.

(Piff et al., p. 890)

...

##### Generosity increased in largeness of forest but not of city

People who experience the largeness of a forest are more likely to be generous than those who experience the largeness of a building  
  
Immersion in cities rather than natural landscapes negatively impacts our generosity, and leaves us more self-focused

> In Study 5 we immersed participants in an awe-inspiring environment: a grove of towering trees. Participants who gazed up at the trees offered more help to an experimenter than did participants who gazed up at a building, and they reported increased ethicality and reduced feelings of entitlement. That these effects emerged after a brief treatment condition (1 min looking at trees) indicates that even fleeting experiences of awe can have a meaningful impact on various types of prosocial judgments and behavior. It is also notable that prosociality (and awe) diverged across two conditions that both involved physically large stimuli, highlighting again that neither awe nor its effects on prosociality is reducible to perceptions of entities simply large in size.

(Piff et al., p. 895)

##### Summary of the 5 studies

> The results of the five studies reported here lend support to this central hypothesis. Individuals higher in dispositional tendencies to experience awe exhibited more generosity in an economic game (Study 1). Experimentally inducing awe caused individuals to endorse more ethical decisions (Study 2), to be more generous to a stranger (Study 3), and to report more prosocial values (Study 4). A naturalistic induction of awe in which participants looked up at a grove of towering trees led to increased helpfulness, greater ethicality, and decreased entitlement (Study 5). These findings highlight that the experience of awe can influence prosociality in a broad fashion, and contribute to the growing literature documenting the centrality of emotions to human sociality

(Piff et al., p. 895)

...

##### The experience of awe doesn't need to be positive to be generative

> In Study 4, a nonnature-based induction of awe as well as a negative induction of awe that also elicited moderate levels of fear and uncertainty both enhanced prosocial tendencies. Awe exerts a specific and likely unique effect on prosociality that is distinct from the influences of other positive emotions, not confounded by more general positive affect, and not reducible to experiences in nature.
