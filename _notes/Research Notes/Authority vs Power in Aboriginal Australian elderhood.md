Authority is earned through knowledge and Merritt, but is not something wieldable for command. The power is not in the authority, it is in the people. The authority guides, it does not decide.*

> Our elders and knowledge keepers do have authority, but they don’t have much power. There is a difference. Authority is something you earn through knowledge, and it cannot be used to command. There are no bosses. We don’t have centralized institutions because those things inevitably fall apart even if they have the best intentions. Power is distributed throughout the community.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 153](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=171&annotation=FAGDUE2K))
