##### Communication and the Sharing Of Meaning

> We communicate to create, recreate, and understand our realities. Communication allows us to control our environments. It is how we know ourselves and how we let others know us. Communication, the process of mutual creation of meaning, is breathtakingly simple and often maddeningly complex.—([Beauchamp and Baran, 2020, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/W3NURKEH))

> Communication, then, is the process of mutual creation of meaning. It is social—it involves people in interaction; it is a process—its parts operate interdependently and continuously; and it is dynamic—it is always changing. This last characteristic defines modern notions of communication as transactional—communication changes the communicators. Each new message, decoded into meaning by an interpreter, changes that interpreter. He or she is no longer the same person, simply by virtue of having added new meanings to his or her set of experiences. In fact, the transactional view assumes that communication has not occurred unless change occurs in the participants (Pearce, Figgins, and Golen, 1984). In a sense, then, communicators enter into a deal, a transaction: the more they work at their negotiation of meaning to better align their fields of experience, the better they can make meaning (in other words, the better they can communicate). Figure 1.4 illustrates the transactional model.—([Beauchamp and Baran, 2020, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/W3NURKEH))

##### Culture Is The World Made Meaningful

> Culture is the world made meaningful; it is socially constructed and maintained through communication. It limits as well as liberates us; it differentiates as well as unites us. It defines our realities and thereby shapes the ways we think, feel, and act. (Baran, 2014, p. 14)—([Beauchamp and Baran, 2020, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/W3NURKEH))
