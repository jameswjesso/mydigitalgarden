*Matriarchy etymology linking more to the beginning of life than the rule of women, being that mater is mother and to mother is to bring into this world.

"Goettner-Abendroth points out that while the term "patriarchy" is associated with domination by males, the etymology of *arche* in "matriarchy," because of women's ability to grow life, better refers to "from the beginning" or the "original pattern from which models are made," the meaning related to *arche* in "archetype." She writes: "Lacking a clear scientific definition of 'matriarchy,' the term has been misunderstood as 'rule by women,' provoking a lasting, ideologically distorted prejudice against it. !e "eld of modern matriarchal studies reorients the field with more precise definitions." Matriarchal societies are centralized around the feminine principle that sources the beginning of every human's life. 

So matriarchy does not refer to "ruling over" but to egalitarianism and freedom for both genders through complementary functions. Goettner-Abendroth identified the characteristics of matriarchies around the world: economic mutuality and a gift economy; matrilineal, nondomination kinship; egalitarian consensus; and sacred cultures of the feminine divine. All these characteristics seem to match up with the Indigenous worldview we are discussing" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=82)) -- Darcia
