## Personal Summary

>[!...]
>
>Aspects of vocal language have multisensory, cross modal integration, such that there is a sensory experience associated with certain sounds that link to brain networks associated with the processes of that sensory information, e.g. soft sounds activate networks associated with the tactile sensation of softness.

## Notes

#### General note on the error of language being formed of purely arbitrary symbolism

> In modern linguistics, it is widely assumed that the acoustic features of a word are arbitrarily associated with its meaning1,2. This assumption is supported by the fact that the same concept is expressed by different sounds in different languages. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that a non-arbitrary association between sound and meaning can exist in some words called sound symbolic wordsâ€”(Kitada et al., 2021, p. 1)

#### Brain regions associated with the sensory perception are activated with the symbolic sounds

They showed that the sound symbolic words show activation in the specific brain regions associated with the sensory perception of what that sound is symbolic of.

*Regarding softness and magnitude of softness*...

> This result indicates that the brain network that processes information of perceived softness is also engaged in processing the associated sound symbolic words. This finding is consistent with the idea that the processing of sound symbolic information involves the sensory-modality dependent regions. For instance, the onomatopoeia of pain can evoke brain activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is considered a part of the pain processing network14. The comparison of visual sizes of stimuli with sound symbolic words activated the occipital lobe as well as the pSTS18â€”(Kitada et al., 2021, p. 7)

#### Proposed brain interactions allowing for the multisensory integration of sound symbolic words and perception of softness

> it is possible that the insula receives the information about softness perceived by touch and softness associated with sound symbolic words, causing the interaction between the two types of information. This speculation is fit to the concept of multisensory integration that occurs in a region with signals of each sensory modalityâ€”(Kitada et al., 2021, p. 7)

  
....  

#### Concluding results indicate association between brain regions


> In conclusion, the insula and the medial parts of the superior frontal gyrus, which were associated with softness magnitudes perceived by touch, showed a congruency effect between softness perceived by touch and softness associated with sound symbolic words. This result indicates that these regions constitute nodes of the network for mapping sound symbolic information onto tactile material information. In contrast to the previous findings on the neural correlates for sound symbolic words, our finding highlights the role of the nodes in the prefrontal cortex for the network of the matching between sound symbolic information and tactile material information.â€”(Kitada et al., 2021, p. 8)
