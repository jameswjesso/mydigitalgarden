>[!Abstract]
> We examined the effects of a two-week nature-based well-being intervention. Undergraduates (N = 395) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: nature, human-built or a business as-usual control. Participants paid attention to how nature (or human-built objects, depending on assignment) in their everyday surroundings made them feel, photographed the objects/scenes that evoked emotion in them and provided a description of emotions evoked. Post-intervention levels of net positive affect, elevating experiences, a general sense of connectedness (to other people, to nature and to life as a whole) and prosocial orientation were significantly higher in the nature group compared to the human-built and control groups. Trait levels of nature connectedness and engagement with beauty did not moderate natureâ€™s beneficial impact on well-being. Qualitative findings revealed significant differences in the emotional themes evoked by nature vs. human-built objects/scenes. This research provides important empirical support for nature involvement as an effective positive psychology intervention.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> Researchers examined the impact of noticing nature on self-reported wellbeing. Specifically, they had people simply notice natural things, photo them, and then describe what they were feeling over the course of two weeks. There was no increased time in nature, significant changes in their routines, or travelling to "immersive" natural areas. Simply to go about their normal lives with the added activity of noticing, photographing, and describing feelings.
> 
>==The results were the group who participating in this practice had significantly increased self-reported wellbeingâ€”positive affect, sense of connectedness (to people, nature, life), and "prosocial orientation"â€”==than that of the control group (no changes or activities), or the group who were given the same exercise but for human-made objects.
>
>These positive effects did not rely on individuals having higher levels of trait nature connection prior to the experiment. 
>
>Those in the nature noticing vs the human-made noticing group also reported more positively valenced feelings to their observations of nature that were directly instigated by that natural thing. Whereas the human-made group reported more negatively valenced feelings and those feelings were usually brought on by memories or association rather than a direct reaction to the object itself.
>
>However, there was not reported increase in sense of meaning associated with any of the groups, which was contrary to other research on noticing nature increasing sense of meaning.

## Notes

### The Eco-Existential Positive Psychology expands the Biophilia hypothesis to address existential concerns

The Eco-Existential Positive Psychology perspective expands upon the Biophilia hypothesis through proposing that intentionally cultivating our biophilic tendencies through actively involving or immersing ourselves in nature can have a positive impact on various existential anxieties.

> Expanding on this hypothesis, the Eco-Existential Positive Psychology (Passmore & Howell, 2014a) perspective proposes that cultivating our innate biophilic tendencies through involvement with the natural world increases our well-being by helping address existential anxieties, such as those concerning isolation and happiness.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 1)

### Nature noticing triggered positive emotions; human-made negative

Those in the nature noticing vs the human-made noticing group reported more positively valenced feelings to their observations of nature, whereas the human-made group reported more negatively valenced feelings.

> The prevalence of specific themes was different for photos of nature vs. photos of human-built objects/scenes. ==Positive emotions such as hopefulness, peacefulness, rejuvenation and awe (which includes feelings of wonder, spirituality and transcendence) were significantly more likely to be associated with nature photos, while negative emotions such as disgust, envy, stress and feeling annoyed were significantly more likely to be associated with photos of human-built objects/scenes.==â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 7)

#### Nature feelings direct response, human-made associative

Additionally, the nature noticing feelings tended to be directly instigated by that natural thing, whereas the human-made noticing feelings were usually brought on by memories or association rather than a direct reaction to the object itself.

> Descriptions that accompanied the built photos were often emotional reactions that appeared to be a response to a memory, activity or function that the individual associated with the built object/scene, rather than an emotion evoked directly by the built object/scene itself.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 6)
....  
> in contrast, descriptions associated with nature photos were, for the most part, emotional reactions that appeared to be evoked directly by the nature object/scene.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 6)
...  
> It appeared that it was nature itself that people were reacting to, rather than, as noted for the human-built condition, a memory, activity or function that the individual associated with the object/scene.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 6)

### Observed increased in wellbeing did not rely on prior trait level nature connectedness

These positive effects did not rely on individuals having higher levels of trait nature connection prior to the experiment. 

> Paying increased attention to everyday nature significantly increased individual well-being, regardless of trait levels of connectedness to nature and engagement with beauty. â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 7)


### Benefits were not dependent on increased time in nature

The wellbeing benefits observed did not require increased time in nature, significant changes in their routines, or travelling to "immersive" natural areas. Simply the act of noticing the natural thing within their normal routines, attending to it, and noting their feelings.


> Moreover, ==the beneficial effects on individual well-being, sense of general connectedness and prosocial orientation were evidenced, despite that participants in the nature condition did not report spending more time in natural settings over the course of the intervention than other participants did==; they simply noticed, and attended to, the nature they encountered in their daily routines.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 7)
> ...
> this intervention did not appear to involve an increase in the amount of time spent in nature. Rather, increases in well-being were achieved simply by asking participants to pay attention to, and reflect on, emotions evoked by natural objects/scenes, everyday nature encountered, but so often overlooked.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 8) 
> ...
> Additionally, ==our findings suggest that nature-based well-being interventions do not necessarily have to involve whole scale lifestyle changes, travelling to more â€˜naturalâ€™ areas, nor modification of oneâ€™s immediate environment in order to be effective.== Thus, there are significant practical implications with regard to ease of implementation for this intervention.â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 8)

....

### No reported increase in meaning in any of the groups

However, there was not reported increase in sense of meaning associated with any of the groups, which was contrary to other research on noticing nature increasing sense of life meaning.

> Contrary to our prediction, post-intervention levels of meaning did not differ between the three conditions. Given that previous research has linked nature affiliation with higher meaning in life (e.g. Howell, Passmore, & Buro, 2013; oâ€™Connor & Chamberlain, 1996),â€”(Passmore and Holder, 2017, p. 8)
