## Notes

#### Wisdom involves a capacity of mind that helps one live a good life.

Wisdom involves a capacity of mind—including perception, cognition, emotions, reasoning, etc.—that "affords the living of a good life." Something that is a part of one's development that engenders a kind of perspective, engagement, and navigation of life. (which is distinct from a good life emerging from good fortune)

> Let us begin the study of wisdom by noting that it involves some kind of cognitive improvement that affords the living of a good life. When we use the term ‘cognition’ or ‘cognitive’, it should be broadly construed as the terms are used in cognitive science, meaning thinking, reasoning, memory, emotion and perception. There are factors such as good fortune that can improve life, but wisdom centres on a kind of self-transformation of cognitive processing that enhances the quality of life in some comprehensive manner.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 21)

  
....  
#### Quote about knowledge and foolishness and wisdom

> as emphasized by Socrates, knowledge on its own is not sufficient for overcoming foolishness, and it is the overcoming of foolishness that is the hallmark of wisdom—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 23)
  
....  

#### Foolishness, and ignorance....

> Foolishness is not ignorance, even if ignorance can foster foolishness. As we have outlined above, the essence of foolishness is a lack of insight that malforms caring. Knowledgeable fools abound, as Stanovich (2002, 2009) and Sternberg (2002) both note; smart (meaning knowledgeable) people can do very stupid (i.e. foolish) things.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 23)

...
  
#### Self-transformation in the overcoming of foolishness

Self-transformation—that is the overcoming of erroneous or maladaptive schemas and patterns of self-deception that prevent us from making changes in ourselves that afford learning from life in such a way as to live is better—is central to wisdom as one of the key limitations to wisdom is foolishness, "self-deceptive patterns that prevent the necessary changes from occurring. (p. 23)"

...

#### All wisdom is personal wisdom

Theoretical knowledge supports one in learning thorough enabling the recognition, and then acquisition, of missing knowledge. However, wisdom is not exclusively the domain matter of theoretical knowledge, but too the capacity to recognize the relevance of what is already known so as to apply it to circumstances wherein what is needed is not theoretical knowledge, but a kind of lived capacity be in touch with what really matters. Being able to do that, though, requires a process wherein we are able to confront ourselves and our own biases, defensiveness, and other "self-deceptive patterns" that prevent us from undergoing the changes in ourselves that would allow for that recognition of what really matters. This is why Vervaeke and Ferraro state that "..."

> self-transformation is central to wisdom and thus all wisdom is inherently personal wisdom.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 23)

Further, it is just the development of theoretical tools, but their application to self-transformation

> Bellah, in his review, emphasizes that this change is not merely the development of theoretical tools but rather the application of these tools to the transformation of narrative and, hence, the self.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 24)

  
....  

#### Wisdom and insight from self-reflection

There is a capacity for a certain quality of insight emerging from self-reflection that is related to wisdom but not reliant on specialized conceptual knowledge

> Wisdom seems to involve a special kind of insight, and this is borne out by the intuition that it is not odd to say ‘Sam is not that educated but he is very wise’ nor is it odd to say ‘Sarah is not that artistic but she is very wise’; however, it does seem quite odd to say ‘Sam is not very insightful but he is very wise’.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 24)

  
....  

#### Wisdom includes the capacity to see beyond the illusion of one's own cognitive processes and into reality

Wisdom is connected to a capacity for self-reflection and insight that is able to see beyond the illusion of how one's own cognitive processes might being hindering their perception, and into a perception of the reality of a situation beyond those hinderances. 

> The connection here is that illusion is some form of self-deception, so seeing through illusion and into reality involves important insight into one’s own cognition and how it might be impeding contact with reality. This type of insight, therefore, involves and enables the self-transformation needed to dispel the illusory processing and facilitate an enhanced interaction with reality. Let us call these depth insights because they involve seeing deeper into our cognition, that is, into the patterns and processes of one’s own learning and perception, in order to break through misleading appearances to an underlying (deeper) reality. Such insights also involve increased abilities of self-understanding and self-transformation, that is, one becomes a deeper person.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 24)

However, reality in this sense is not some kind of ultimate truth on the metaphysical nature of existence, but a kind of being in greater connection with the underlying factors and causes at play in whatever situation one is seeing beyond the illusion of. 

> In this sense, seeing into reality is seeing into the nature of our problems, to be able to understand the challenges before us in a manner that facilitates their solution. It does not mean unlocking the metaphysical secrets of the universe but rather appreciating what needs to be done and knowing how to do it.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 25)

  
....  

#### Insight is the result of relevance realization

Insight is the result of relevance realization, which is the capacity to identify what is relevant to whatever cognitive processes is underway, within a larger perceptual landscape of options, thus framing (or reframing) or perspective.  
  
It is a matter of finding patterns and the sub-factors of those patterns, that are relevant to our goals.  
  
Something like being able to identify signal in noise, specific to the problem or process at hand, and to then both utilize that signal to one's intended ends while effectively ignoring the noise  
  
This is an underlying cognitive process that plays a central role to cognition as a whole.

> we need to see insight as a specific and explicit phenomenological experience of a more pervasive and often implicit cognitive process that is central to cognition, namely, relevance realization—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 25)

> This is the heart of relevance realization: to be able to usefully ignore information in a contextually sensitive manner so as to enable our actions.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 28)

  
....  
#### The three aspects of relevance realization  
  
Similar to the words in a sentence [their metaphor], importance is there individual relevance in that sentence and their corelevance is how their relevance to each other.  
  
For an person, importance is the aspect of relevance that pertains to the satisfaction of one's goal, and corelevance, like words in a sentence, is about the patterns of information and the identification of what important information.  
  
Transcendence, for a person, is about the information that, when learned and shared, enables us greater participation and belonging in our social groups. It is about what keeps up relevant to others.

> Importance signifies information that is relevant to satisfying the individual’s goals, while co-relevance is about patterns in information that help us to find and make use of important information.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 29)

> By finding patterns of co-relevance, we can facilitate the discovery of important information. Some of the patterns we realize are patterns in events.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 29)

Outline of these three aspects:

> to summarize, there are three dimensions to relevance realization: corelevance, importance and transcendence. These abilities to realize relevance support finding different kinds of patterns: there are patterns in events, which afford procedural knowledge; patterns in facts, which afford propositional knowledge; and, finally, patterns in participation, which afford perspectival knowledge.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, pp. 30-31)

  
....  
#### Procedural, propositional, and perspectival knowledge  
  
Procedural knowledge is the knowledge of how to do thing. This is connected to importance.

> This patterning gives us the ability to intervene in causal processes, that is, it affords us knowing how to interact with the world. This is our procedural knowledge. We can also find patterns of patterns, that is, higher-order patterns. Especially important are finding patterns that are invariant across many different contexts and are multiply realized in many different causal processes.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 29)

Propositional is the knowledge of something being a thing, "knowing that something is the case". It is connected to co-relevance.

> Such patterns are indications of causal conditions as general principles. Knowledge of such principles that constrain and enable how events unfold is knowledge of facts. This is our knowing that something is the case. It is our propositional knowledge.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 29)

Perspectival is knowing how things are relevant to other things—eg. as event to facts and facts to events—such that we are enabled the capacity to effectively narrativize our sense of participation in a particular situation. "to participate in it with a particular role/identity." This is connected to transcendence.

> As inherently social creatures, we need to be relevant to others, and we need to say and do things that are relevant to others. Not only does information need to belong together and to us, but we also need to emit and transmit information that can belong to others, that is, we need to participate in and belong to a group.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 29)

> Perspectival knowledge is not just knowledge of how events are relevant to each other or how facts are relevant to each other. It is knowledge of how facts are relevant to events (constrain and enable sequences of events) and how events are relevant to facts (how events can change constraining and enabling conditions). This enables one to narratively know what it is like to be in a particular situation, that is, to participate in it with a particular role/identity. This is to have a perspective. It enables one to be relevant to the world.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, pp. 30-31)


...
  
#### Although expertise can exist within wisdom, wisdom can exist without expertise.

> Since wisdom is tied to both self-transformation and the cultivation of a good life, it stands to reason that wisdom must centre upon the procedural knowledge that realizes the important information that affords one the ability to intervene in the causal processes of self transformation and the construction of a good life.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, pp. 30-31)

  
....  
#### two ways wisdom differs from expertise

Expertise is neutral in its value and impact. It can be used for good or for ill (e.g. nuclear science can be used for bomb or for medicine) but wisdom is always oriented towards the good.

Expertise is usually about something specific, whereas wisdom is something that informs cognition in general, in a broad reaching way.


> How might wisdom differ from expertise? One significant difference is that expertise is largely value neutral. One can use one’s expertise for good or for evil, yet wisdom seems to be inherently virtuous: it can only be about making life good. Also, expertise seems to be limited to specific domains with redundant features that support specific practice and provide feedback. In contrast, wisdom is a higher order construct that informs cognition in general. It is not domain specific, and in this way, it is more like intelligence and relevance realization in its broadly general scope (see below on intelligence and relevance realization).—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, pp. 30-31)

  
....  
#### Wisdom is a perceptual capacity that allows us to live a good life


> Wisdom therefore involves seeing the world comprehensively in such a way that one can regulate one’s actions into alignment with realizing a good life.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 31)

  
....  

#### A brief list of how different wisdom traditions frame the development of wisdom

> Many schools of thought suggest that wisdom involves just such a self-organizing nature. For example, Taoism emphasizes that wisdom involves becoming an empty vessel for the Tao. Buddhism emphasizes that the eightfold path should be understood as an eight-spoked wheel in which all the components feed into each other and ‘roll’ along. The Platonic tradition emphasizes the importance of a dialogue between people that has a life of its own. The Neo-platonic tradition emphasizes the advent of the one being something that happens to someone seeking enlightenment. Csikszentmihalyi and Rathmunde (1990) emphasize the importance of ‘flow’ to wisdom. In short, it is commonly believed that the pursuit of wisdom involves the cultivation of the conditions for wisdom, but that wisdom itself takes shape within individuals and very much has a life of its own.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 34)


....

#### Relevance Realization is not just an intellectual process

Relevance realization is comprised of various forms and expressions of knowledge, but it is not merely an intellectual process. It is an attentional process, but also "affective [feeling] and motivational." It is a matter of careabouts and what information we care for.

> Relevance realization is always a matter of the selective direction of attention, the appraisal of value and the rationing and commitment of processing resources. It is simultaneously attentional, affective and motivational. Relevance realization largely concerns how you care about and care for information. Since it involves selection, judgment of value and the rationing of resources, it can be evaluated according to standards of rationality. However, the rationality involved will not be the rationality of theoretical argumentation but a rationality of construal and caring, that is, it will be a type of rationality that prominently figures in depth insights.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 31)

  
....  

#### We cannot form a theory of relevance, only of relevance realization

Being that we are not able to reliably define a stable and consistent class for the content of relevance, which is what science would require for the formation of a theory, we cannot form a theory of relevance, but only of relevance realization.

> there cannot be a theory of relevance; there can only be a theory of relevance realization.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 32)

  
....  

#### Like evolutionary fitness, what is relevant is in a constant state of redefinition according to shifting context

Like evolutionary fitness, what is relevant is in a constant state of redefinition in accordance to shifting context. That state of redefinition unfolds through the ongoing framing and reframing process of relevance realization.

> Evolutionary processes are constantly redefining from within evolution what it means to be fit. Likewise, relevance realization must constantly be redefining from within relevance realization what it means for information to be relevant.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 32)

  
.... 

#### There cannot be a complete definition of wisdom.

There cannot be a complete definition of wisdom, as wisdom is an outcome of cognitive process that presents and evolves based on [[@grossmannWisdomContext2017|context-specific]] variables. However, the underlying cognitive processes that give rise to wisdom and the aspects and qualities of their consequence can be outlined

> wisdom is an inherently pluralistic phenomenon. What counts as wise is going to vary from time to time and place to place. However, the self-organizing and self-defining processes of relevance realization that comprise wisdom are universal, and therefore, there can be a science of how wisdom is realized within cognitive processes. This means that in a deep sense, there cannot be a universal and complete product theory of wisdom.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 32)

  
....  

#### Self-organizing criticality in the brain and relevance realization (and intelligence)

Self-organizing criticality... like the pile of sand building from the steady stream of sand onto it builds a cone that periodically collapses to establish a wider base for a more stable cone, so too does the brain go through periods of stability and instability in response to input, wherein the latter helps to build new "emergent structures that reorganize and restabalize the system".  

...[[Intentional Psychedelic Use To Direct Shifts In Relevance Realization Through Self-organizing Criticality|idea on how this relates to psychedelics here]]...

> The brain is a dynamical system with multiple feedback loops that create periods of stable organization followed by transition periods of instability in response to inputs to the system. These periods make possible new emergent structures that reorganize and restabilize the system.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 33)


This same self-organizing criticality of the brain itself (and the neuronal-systems level) is the manner by which the brain undergoes the self-organizing criticality of relevance realization as well, which is also the same process that underwrites intelligence itself.

> the self-organizing criticality found in the brain is a powerful way that the brain implements the self-organizing process of relevance realization and, moreover, that this is the basic ability that makes us intelligent.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 33)

  
....  
>[!warning] This requires re-reading to better integrate
> the connection between relevance realizing self-organizing criticality and intelligence helps to explain how brains can be dynamically intelligent in a dynamically complex world;—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 33)

  
....  
#### Foolishness is the opposite of wisdom

>[!NOTE]
>
>Foolishness is the opposite of wisdom. (Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 34)


...
  
#### "Foolishness is parasitic processing" emerging from errors in the adaptive function of self-organizing criticality 

The feedback loop processes of self-organizing criticality that allows for the brain to be adaptive as life unfolds also allows for the development of complex but stable patterns of behaviour that still allow for adaptability, change, and learning.. This process however can become hijacked and we can get locked into patterns of perception and behaviour, locked into reduced capacity to adapt, change and learn.  
  
This is a state different than ignorance or "lack of intelligence". It is the that of foolishness. This foolishness compromises our brain/mind's capacity to process reality, contributing to self-reinforcing and maladaptive perceptions and behaviours.  
  
"Foolishness is parasitic processing"

> In a manner analogous to a computer virus, the dynamical processes of the brain can get caught up in self-destructive feedback loops that are very compulsive and highly resistant to change because they have hijacked the selforganizing criticality of the brain. Foolishness is parasitic processing.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 34)
  
....  
#### Why intelligent people can act foolishly  
  
Because foolishness is not a matter of intelligence or lacking knowledge, but a matter of maladaptive expression of informational processing at a deeper level of cognition.

> Perkins’ theory has much going for it in that it helps dissolve the seeming paradox of foolishness, that is, how it is that knowledgeable and intelligent people can perform stupid actions. There is no paradox, in that foolishness is not simply a matter of lacking factual knowledge, nor does it involve any mysterious processing. Rather, the very same processing that makes us intelligent also makes us vulnerable to foolishness; foolishness is, in this sense, inevitable.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 35)

(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 35) Foolishness as parasitic processing loop.

#### Wisdom counteracts foolishness by seeing through illusions

> If wisdom ameliorates the self-destructive nature of foolishness, it will do so through cognitive processes that see through the illusions of self-deception.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 36)

  
....  

#### Foolishness reinforced maladaptive behaviours through the misconstruing of problems and situations

The parasitic processing of foolishness creates self-reinforcing loop of misconstruing problems and situations to the result of locking us into a misjudging of the co-relevance and importance of information.

> We argue that the self deception of foolishness is largely about being locked into a feedback loop that maintains and reinforces an inappropriate construal of problems, that is, a misframing of problems and situations, that cause one to misjudge the co-relevance and importance of the information presented—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 38)

  
....  

#### Self-deception arises from a lack of cognitive flexibility keeping us stuck in illusion

> In short, self-deception is a self imposed lack of the cognitive flexibility needed for depth insights, so that we trap ourselves in illusion—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 38)

  
....  
#### Active open-mindedness definition, a concept from Jonathan Baron

> AOM means actively looking for the ways in which bias warps and thwarts our problem solving.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 39)

  
....  
>[!Quote] This is a wild sentence.
> Wisdom relies upon a meta-style of rationally self-transcending rationality that governs the rational cognitive styles of mindfulness and AOM in a manner that enhances the developmental complexification of information processing that constitutes basic general intelligence.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 40)

  
....  
#### The three dimensions of living a good life

There are three dimensions necessary for us to live a good life. 

- A subjective sense of wellbeing... that we feel good in ourselves, about ourselves, and about life (including in our capacity to manage the challenges life bears forth).
- That our we, as an individual, and the life we are living must be something that is "judged and experience as morally respectable"... this is not just something we decided within ourselves, but is also attributed to us by those we respect.
- That life has a sense of meaning... the sense of meaning is life is the sense that one is connected to something that is meaningful beyond their personal attribution of meaning, to something larger than one's self.

there is an excellent possibility here to explore this particular section to the consideration of psilocybin (and psychedelics in general) assisting us in living a good life.


> Thus, the conditions that afford a good life are the judgment and experience of one’s life as satisfying, virtuous (morally good) and deeply connected.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 41)

  
....  

#### The Sense of Meaning in Life

The sense of meaning is life is the sense that one is connected to something that is meaningful beyond their personal attribution of meaning, to something larger than one's self.

> Meaning in life is to judge and experience oneself as connected appropriately to something that has an important value independent from one’s valuing of it. To put it more loosely, one needs to feel connected to something ‘bigger’ than oneself,—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 41)
  
  
....  

#### The wise person applies perspectival knowledge towards cultivating connection

The wise person has a strong capacity to applying perspectival knowledge to the focus of cultivating greater connection (e.g. the relevance realization dimension of transcendence)

> The wise person would have depth insights into the processes by which selves/identities/persons are constituted, protected and promoted. These depth insights mean that the wise person is very focused on the transcendence dimension of relevance realization.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 41)

  
....  
#### Self-transcendent self-knowledge is the cultivation of selves knowledge

Self-knowledge in the context of the self-transcendence necessary for wisdom involves not just about knowledge of our personal self, but of what it is to be a self.  From here it is the cultivation of learning what support a self in living a good life, which is then cross-transferable to selves in general and not just our personal self. [[@fadimanYourSymphonySelves2020|This links with the many selves hypothesis of Fadiman and Gruber]]


> This concern for transcendence means that the self-knowledge involved is not primarily autobiographical knowledge nor narcissistic knowledge. It is the perspectival knowledge of what it is like to be a self and the linked procedural and propositional abilities to cultivate selves. This knowledge results in knowing what is good for selves and how to bring about what is good for selves.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 41)

  

  
....  

#### Wisdom as self-knowledge that support themselves and others in living a good life

Wisdom as self-knowledge that support themselves and others in living a good life through aligning perspectival awareness with a self-transcending vision of that good life.

> Such self-knowledge involves knowing how to be virtuous, how to promote virtue and how to protect selves, their projects and meaning in life from vice. This means that self-knowledge involves the perspectival awareness of how to align actions to a self-transcending vision of a good life to which the person cultivating wisdom is committed and to which they belong.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 42)

  
....  

#### A practice for the cultivation of wisdom through the imaginative engagement of wondering about a situation/event through the perspective of a sage. 

E.g. WWJD?

> ‘internalizing the sage’.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 43)

  
....  
#### Wisdom traditions, turning theory into practice 

> All of the above wisdom traditions placed a high priority on turning theory into practice.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 43)

  
.... 

#### Internalizing the sage practice as a process of integrating wisdom

> So it is plausible that internalizing the sage involves both taking the perspective of the sage on one’s cognition, as a kind of heightened third-person perspective on one’s cognitive processing that enhances learning to learn, and then taking the perspective of the sage on the world, as a kind of heightened first-person perspective that transforms one’s salience landscape so as to implement the insights gained through learning to learn. Finally, this orientation is trained until it becomes a habit of mind and a way of life.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 44)

  
....  

#### A wise person does not just resist what is not good, but is calibrated towards a general inclination towards what is good.

> Our theory holds that a wise person does not merely thwart or resist temptation but rather calibrates his or her salience landscapes in such a way as to not be drawn to negative behaviours and to be attracted to beneficial ones.—(Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2013, p. 46)
