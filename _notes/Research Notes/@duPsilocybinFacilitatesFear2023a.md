>[!Abstract]
> BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are highly comorbid. Psilocybin exerts substantial therapeutic effects on depression by promoting neuroplasticity. Fear extinction is a key process in the mechanism of first-line exposure-based therapies for PTSD. We hypothesized that psilocybin would facilitate fear extinction by promoting hippocampal neuroplasticity. 
>
> METHODS: First, we assessed the effects of psilocybin on percentage of freezing time in an auditory cued fear conditioning (FC) and fear extinction paradigm in mice. Psilocybin was administered 30 min before extinction training. Fear extinction testing was performed on the first day; fear extinction retrieval and fear renewal were tested on the sixth and seventh days, respectively. Furthermore, we verified the effect of psilocybin on hippocampal neuroplasticity using Golgi staining for the dendritic complexity and spine density, Western blotting for the protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and immunofluorescence staining for the numbers of doublecortin (DCX)- and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells.
>
 > RESULTS: A single dose of psilocybin (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the increase in the percentage of freezing time induced by FC at 24 h, 6th day and 7th day after administration. In terms of structural neuroplasticity, psilocybin rescued the decrease in hippocampal dendritic complexity and spine density induced by FC; in terms of neuroplasticity related proteins, psilocybin rescued the decrease in the protein levels of hippocampal BDNF and mTOR induced by FC; in terms of neurogenesis, psilocybin rescued the decrease in the numbers of DCX- and BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus induced by FC.
>
> CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of psilocybin facilitated rapid and sustained fear extinction; this effect might be partially mediated by the promotion of hippocampal neuroplasticity. This study indicates that psilocybin may be a useful adjunct to exposure-based therapies for PTSD and other mental disorders characterized by failure of fear extinction.

## Notes

#### Psilocybin assisted fear extinction in a rapid and sustained way, this is related to increased neuroplasticity

When administered prior to fear extinction training, psilocybin showed excellent effect in support that training.

> ...
> ==Our findings suggest that psilocybin facilitated rapid and sustained fear extinction when administered before fear extinction training.==â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2988)
....  
> a single dose of psilocybin facilitated rapid and sustained fear extinction; ==this effect may have been partially mediated by the promotion of hippocampal neuroplasticity==.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2990)

#### Fear conditioning reduced dendrite and spine density in hippocampus, psilocybin corrects

They noted that this fear conditioning reduced dendrite and spine density in hippocampus and that psilocybin seemed to help "rescue" those decreases.


> Psilocybin rescued the decrease in hippocampal dendritic complexity and spine density induced by FCâ€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987)
.... 
> The total number of dendritic branches and the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus were significantly decreased induced by FC (for total number of dendritic branches: t = 2.808, df = 30, P = 0.009, Figure 2A, C; for density of dendritic spines: t = 3.602, df = 30, P = 0.001, Figures 2B, D). Interestingly, these negative changes were rescued by 2.5 mg/kg psilocybin 7 days after treatment (for total number of dendritic branches: t = 2.266, df = 30, P = 0.031; for density of dendritic spines: t = 4.057, df = 30, P <0.001), ==which suggested that psilocybin rescued hippocampal dendritic complexity and spine density, both of which were decreased by FCâ€”==(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987)

....  

#### Psilocybin corrected BDNF and mTOR levels, increasing neuroplasticity in hippocampus

There are decreases in BDNF and mTOR after FC, (their model for PTSD) and psilocybin brought those levels back.

> Psilocybin rescued the decrease in the protein levels of hippocampal BDNF and mTOR induced by FCâ€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987)

In doing so, it also had "profound" effects on neuroplasticity, specificity though the BDNF and mTOR pathways, and specifically in the hippocampus

> ==Psilocybin elicits profound changes in neuroplasticity through the BDNF and mTOR signaling pathways==.[18] Western blot analysis indicated that FC significantly decreased the protein levels of BDNF (t = 4.340, df = 10, P = 0.002, Figure 3A) and mTOR (t = 2.431, df = 10, P = 0.035, Figure 3B) ==in the hippocampus==. Compared to vehicle-treated mice, psilocybin-treated mice showed a reversal of these negative changes in BDNF (t = 3.196, df = 10, P = 0.009, Figure 3A) and mTOR (t = 2.243, dfâ€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987)

#### Psilocybin's neuroplasticity effect was tracked as being realted to dendritogenesis 

This neuroplasticity effect was tracked as being related to dendritogenesis (complexity and spine density) through those being the aspects of the brain that was damaged by the FC and seemingly rescued by Psilocybin. 

> The ==psilocybin induced facilitation of fear extinction coincided with the promotion of hippocampal neuroplasticity, including the rescue of the decreases in dendritic complexity, spine density, the protein levels of BDNF and mTOR==, and the number of DCX- and BrdU-positive cells induced by FC.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987-2988)

#### Damage to dendrites is associated with PTSD through their FC model, psilocybin  possible for PTSD treatment 

Damage to dendrites is associated with PTSD through their FC model, and thus their correction by psilocybin suggestion possibilities for PTSD treatment 

> Our results indicated that FC decreased the density of dendritic spines and the total number of dendritic branches. ==The dendritic arbor is responsible for receiving and consolidating neuronal inputs;[39] thus, decreases in dendritic complexity and spine density may lead to negative behavioral changes, i.e., PTSD-like symptoms.== 
> 
> A single dose of psilocybin reversed these negative changes, which suggests that psilocybin induced facilitation of fear extinction was at least partially mediated by the promotion of hippocampal neuroplasticityâ€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2990)
>...
> Our results suggest that psilocybin may be a useful adjunct to exposure-based therapies for PTSD and other mental disorders characterized by the failure of fear extinction.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2990)



....
#### The BDNF and mTOR pathway and hippocampus neuroplasticity is involved in the positive effects of psilocybin

Given their observations of the fear extinction support, and the effects of BDNF and mTOR and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus, the authors propose that these pathways are an important part of psilocybin's effects. 

> Psilocybin ameliorated the decreases in hippocampal BDNF and mTOR protein levels induced by FC, suggesting that BDNF and mTOR signaling is associated with the effects of psilocybin. ==This finding also suggests that hippocampal neuroplasticity is involved in the psilocybin induced facilitation of fear extinction==.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2990)


....
#### Single dose psilocybin had rapid and sustained effect on fear extinction, 24h and 7days later 

> Encouragingly, our results suggested that a single dose of psilocybin facilitated rapid and sustained fear extinction starting at 24 h after administration and for up to 7 days.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987)
> ...
> we found that a single dose of psilocybin exerted fear extinction effects at 24 h after administration and that these effects lasted for 7 days.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2989)



#### Results suggest psilocybin as a therapeutic agent for FC (PTSD)

Previous research on psilocybin and fear conditioning was administration prior to FC, showing positive prophylactic effects. The present study was after the FC, suggesting therapeutic effect.

> Our results were consistent with a study conducted in 2013, which showed that psilocybin facilitated fear extinction after trace FC.[21] However, in the previous study, psilocybin was administered before FC; thus, the administration was prophylactic. In real life, it is impossible to predict the onset of traumatic events, and prophylactic administration is not feasible. Therefore, in our study, psilocybin was administered 2 days after FC; thus, the treatment was therapeutic rather than prophylactic.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2988)



#### Psilocybin reduced levels of DCX, a marker of damaged neuroplasticity. 

> Doublecortin (DCX) is a neurogenesis marker associated with neuroplasticity.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2987)
> ...
> Our results showed that a single dose of ==psilocybin reversed the decrease in the number of DCXpositive cells in the hippocampal DG== induced by FC at 7 days after administration, ==which suggested that psilocybin promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG==.â€”(Du et al., 2023, p. 2990)
