## Personal Summary

>[!...]
>
> This paper explored the relationship between the tactile sensation in the mouth while making sounds and the meaning associated to those sounds. Specifically, between the experience of friction of airflow in the mouth while making consonant sounds and the perception of roughness.

## Notes

#### Examples of Sound symbolism for DL

> Furthermore, the auditory features of the speech sounds may also be semantically compatible with their represented meaning. For example, mouth size is larger when articulating /a/ than /i/ and therefore participants were more likely to associate the label with /a/ to a larger object than a smaller objectâ€”(Lo et al., 2017, p. 157)

#### Associated roughness sensation in mouth during sounds to perception of rough surfaces

> Our tongues and lips are certainly sensitive to roughness (Kohyama, 2014;Mennella & Beauchamp, 1998), which can further be integrated with other sensory experiences (Rochat, 1989; Rose, Gottfried, & Bridger, 1981). With such capacity, the present study (in Experiment 2) therefore sought to verify the role of fricative consonants in participantsâ€™ formed associations with the concept of roughness, which is seldom discussed in the reviewed literature.â€”(Lo et al., 2017, p. 160)
#### Results of second study suggest connection between plosives and rough surfaces

> Sound symbolism was not supported by the results in Experiment 1 where participants did not show any strong preferences for assigning labels with initial fricative consonants to either spiky frames or curved frames. Nevertheless, participants in Experiment 2 were more likely to assign labels with initial fricative (or plosive) consonants to the materials with rough (or smooth) surface. In other words, sound symbolism based on tactile stimuli was supported.â€”(Lo et al., 2017, p. 163)

#### Phonological awareness can also be driven by conditioning, so it is not always present that one makes these associations.

> Unlike alphabetic writing systems, Cantonese, which is one of the Chinese dialects, has no grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rule. Cantonese-speaking children have been found to have less phonological awareness compared to their English-speaking counterparts (Yeung et al., 2011). This does not mean that Cantonese speakers are unable to perceive (or produce) phonological differenced, but they usually do not have detailed mental representations to denote phonological features. It is possible that people with this linguistic background might need to be shown a very obvious linkage between the consonants and the corresponding visual concept in order to formulate associations.â€”(Lo et al., 2017, p. 163)
