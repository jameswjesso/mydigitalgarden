> Amor means love. Fati means fate. Amor fati is a Latin expression that means loving your fate, including suffering and loss. The key to achieving Amor Fati is an attitude of deep acceptance of the events that take place in your life. It is the practice of embracing what happens, particularly the painful things.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=70&annotation=X2X2XSM2))
