##### Maria Sabina saw that the mushrooms were not the medicine itself, but that they diagnosed and gave perspective on what needs healing and why. It was then up to the patient and the curandero to take it from there

> "They did not heal like a medicine; they diagnosed and revealed truths that led to healing."



##### Overt focus on mystical exp in psychedelic research/reporting minimizes the importance of making changes in one's life


> When research focuses on the ability of psychedelics to trigger mystical experiences, it risks glorifying brief moments of chemical ecstasy while minimizing the need to actually change and improve oneâ€™s day-to-day life.
