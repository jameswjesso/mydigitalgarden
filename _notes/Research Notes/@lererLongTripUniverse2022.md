## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This article outlines the potential role psychedelics, especially psilocybin, may play in supporting the mental and physical health of individuals undergoind long duration space travel. This includes as a part of the training to go into space, as well as a part of their diet while in space.

## Notes

#### The space exposome is the "underlying framework" for all the various stressors particular to space travel, and their interactions with each other.

The space exposome is the "underlying framework" for all the various stressors particular to space travel, and their interactions with each other.

> the unifying framework that reflects the interaction of all space-related stressors has been defined as the space exposome‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 1)

  
....  

#### Human health is degraded by isolation/confinement

The negative physiological effects of isolation and confinement as observed in various explorers (polar, submarine, etc) reflects that humans are effectively degraded in their health by that isolation/confinement.

> Research on polar exploration, submarines, solitary confinement, undersea habitats, and space simulations provides a wealth of evidence that humans are indeed eminently sensitive to isolation and confinement, manifesting neurocognitive changes, fatigue, misaligned circadian rhythms, sleep disorders, altered stress hormone levels, and immune system dysfunction‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 2)

  
....  

#### "cognitive reserve" damaged by long space travel, inducing nueroplasticity may offset

One of the negative effects of long space travel is degradation of motor function and "cognitive reserve". Agents that can induce neuroplasticity may help offset this.

> Deleterious effects of sojourns in space on the brain include changes in motor function and reduction in cognitive reserve, making it important that innovative approaches to enhancing neuroplasticity be developed‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 3)

#### Consuming psychedelics will result in astronauts desiring less meat and protein (?)

It seems like they are suggesting that consuming psychedelic will result in astronauts desiring less meat and protein. I don't know where they are basing this assumption.

> A diet that includes psychedelic biomass may not only be healthier but also has the potential to complement strategies to reduce dependence on high protein foods and cell-based animal meat, thereby saving energy and resources on a lengthy space mission.‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 3)

  
....  

##### Perperual low-level psilocybin intake as a part of space travel diet?

It seems like you are suggesting a kind of constant low level intake.

> In order to avoid any neurocognitive effects of ingesting psychoactive substances, it may be possible to grow mycelial biomass that contains only trace amounts of psilocybin or grow genetically engineered ‚Äúpsychedelic mushrooms‚Äù that do not produce psilocybin.‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 3)

  
....  

#### Long space trips negatively impact the microbiome

Long space trips negatively impact the microbiome, reducing it richness and diversity, as well as increasing represention of more harmful bacteria.

> The gut microbiome of astronauts has been monitored since the 1970s and studies have highlighted that long stays in space impact the microbiome, reducing microbial richness and diversity and increasing levels of pathogenic bacteria (Shreiner et al., 2015; Tesei et al., 2022).‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 4)

  
....  

#### Psychedelics' anti-inflammatory effects potentially related to their effect on the microbiome

> The link between the gut microbiome and nervous system inflammatory pathways provides limited support for considering that psychedelics may exert some of their positive effects through indirect modulation of the gut-brain axis‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 4)

  
....  

#### Consumption of psychedelics during long space travel might help support healthy mindset

Consumption of psychedelics during long space travel might help with keeping people in a fresh mindset, creative, empathic, insightful, and generally with¬† a greater sense of meaning.

> Given the psychological pressures of long-duration space travel at an individual and group level, it is useful to consider the potential positive, adaptive effects of the psychedelic experience that include enriched states of consciousness, enhanced cognitive flexibility, heightened creativity, enhanced ability to attribute meaning and value, empathy, enhanced insightfulness, and self-awareness‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 5)

  
....  

#### Use of DMT as a kind of advance training for encounters with other forms of live.

> Long-distance space travelers may encounter other forms of life. Experience with DMT may provide some limited familiarity to experiences of transcendence, out-of-body experiences, entry into other realms or dimensions or the afterlife, and meetings with other presences or entities‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 5)

  
....  

#### Use of psychedelics to help astronauts process and accept death as a consequence of being that far out in space

Use of psychedelics to help astronauts process and accept death as a consequence of being that far out in space, that they will not be coming home to Earth.

> As we journey farther and farther from the earth and stretch technological limits, it is important to consider that space travelers may be faced with a situation where return to earth is impossible and death in space is inevitable. There is some archaeological data supporting the use of psychedelics to ameliorate mental states at the end of life (Socha et al., 2022) and evidence of the utility of psychedelics in the management of depression and existential distress associated with end-stage cancer and in assisting with the acceptance of death in terminal care‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 5)

  
....  
#### General statement about psychedelics supporting long duration space travel.

> Psychedelics, and psychedelic mushrooms in particular, could play a role in supporting human adaption to space through the promotion of neuroplasticity, modulation of inflammatory pathways, and in improving general wellbeing. It is indeed possible that enhanced neuroplasticity may be a potential facilitator of successful long-duration space missions and future human settlement on other planets‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 5)

### Potential Interview Questions

What do you see as some of the risks associated with this, both in coming to ascertain it's practical use and application as well as in that actual use and application during space flight.... how do you see us preemptively compensating for those risks?

(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 5)

What does this mean?

> A diet that includes psychedelic biomass may not only be healthier but also has the potential to complement strategies to reduce dependence on high protein foods and cell-based animal meat, thereby saving energy and resources on a lengthy space mission.‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 3)


What dietary protocol are you proposing? It seems like you are suggesting a kind of constant low level intake.

> In order to avoid any neurocognitive effects of ingesting psychoactive substances, it may be possible to grow mycelial biomass that contains only trace amounts of psilocybin or grow genetically engineered ‚Äúpsychedelic mushrooms‚Äù that do not produce psilocybin.‚Äî(Lerer and Varia, 2022, p. 3)
