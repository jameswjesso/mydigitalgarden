**Flattening the World Space Landscape (definition)**

Flattening of the World Space Landscape refers to the increasing of the "state repertoire" by making states/column activation/hypotheses less constrained to a particular subset by changing the access gap between "favoured and disfavoured" states, as determined and sculpted by the brain over our lives and evolution. ([Gallimore, 2022, p. 254](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ))

> At low doses, when cortical excitation predominates, ketamine flattens the World Space Landscape in a manner similar to the classic psychedelics, increasing the state repertoire by lowering the energetic gap between favoured and disfavoured states.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 254](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=254&annotation=X5L776VB))

....  
World Space is only cortical states where we experiences phenomenological worlds, states that represent unconsciousness do not count. They are more like the no-world space.

> the cortical state space are also within the World Space, which comprises only those states that represent experienced phenomenal worlds.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 254](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=254&annotation=6KGXB5LF))
