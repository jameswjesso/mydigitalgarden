>[!Abstract]
> Research suggests that contact with nature can be beneficial, for example leading to improvements in mood, cognition, and health. A distinct but related idea is the personality construct of subjective nature connectedness, a stable individual difference in cognitive, affective, and experiential connection with the natural environment. Subjective nature connectedness is a strong predictor of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors that may also be positively associated with subjective well-being. This meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between nature connectedness and happiness. Based on 30 samples (n= 8523), a fixed-effect meta-analysis found a small but significant effect size (r = 0.19). ==Those who are more connected to nature tended to experience more positive affect, vitality, and life satisfaction compared to those less connected to nature. Publication status, year, average age, and percentage of females in the sample were not significant moderators.== Vitality had the strongest relationship with nature connectedness (r = 0.24), followed by positive affect (r = 0.22) and life satisfaction (r = 0.17). In terms of specific nature connectedness measures, associations were the strongest between happiness and inclusion of nature in self r = 0.27), compared to nature relatedness (r = 0.18) and connectedness to nature (r = 0.18). This research highlights the importance of considering personality when examining the psychological benefits of nature. The results suggest that closer human-nature relationships do not have to come at the expense of happiness. Rather, this meta-analysis shows that being connected to nature and feeling happy are, in fact, connected.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> They present that high levels of nature connection tend are positively and significantly associated with higher levels of hedonic measures of happiness. 
> 
> This correlation is strong enough that it warrants consideration as a major factor in happiness, alongside factors such as education, marital status, personality traits, physical attractiveness, etc.

## Notes

### The Biophilia Hypothesis is not required to understand the harms of detachment from Nature

The biophilia hypotheses is not a necessary requirement for the proposal of how modern non nature living environments negatively affect human wellbeing. This is because, irrespective of Biophilia, it is clear that the environments we presently live in are contrary to those that we evolved to thrive and flourish within, thus making them suboptimal for human health.

This related to Daniel Vitalis' premise that our modern society, and the modern domicile, [[Modern life is a combination of a poorly designed zoo and a factory farm - Daniel Vitalis|amounts to come combination of a poorly designed zoo and a factory farm. ]]

> Evolutionary psychology more generally suggests that modern environments are not optimally suited to minds that evolved in different (more natural) environments (e.g., Barkow et al., 1992; Buss, 2000).Thus, the specific biophilia hypothesis is not needed to retain the more general evolutionary idea of modern gaps in optimal human-environment fit.â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 1)

### There are many different scales that have been developed to measure human-nature relationships

There are many different scales that have been developed to measure human-nature relationships. However, the all seem to be effectively exploring the same underlying thing from different angles: Nature Connectedness.

> A variety of concepts and measures have been developed in order to assess the human-nature relationship, including commitment to nature (Davis et al., 2009), connectedness to nature(Mayer and Frantz, 2004), connectivity with nature (Dutcheret al., 2007), emotional affinity toward nature (Kals et al., 1999),environmental identity (Clayton, 2003), inclusion of nature in self (Schultz, 2001), and nature relatedness (Nisbet et al.,2009)â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 2)
....  
> Despite these different concepts and measures, they all appear to be assessing slightly different expressions of the same under-lying construct (i.e., oneâ€™s subjective connection to nature)â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 2)
....  
> nature connectedness will be used as an umbrella term for all of them.â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 3)

  
....  
### This meta-analysis focused on measures of hedonic (vs eudaimonic) well-being with respect to nature connectedness

There are two main conceptualizations of happiness or wellbeing. That of hedonic and eudaimonic. Their differences and overlaps are explored [[Hedonic vs Eudaimonic Happiness|here]]. 
 
In summary, hedonic is where happiness/wellbeing is something that is derived from affective and cognitive satisfaction and pleasure; and eudaimonic presents that wellbeing/happiness comes from the pursuit of meaningful goals that are in alignment with our deepest values, offering us a sense that we are realizing our "fullest potential". 

This meta-analysis focused on measures of hedonic well-being with respect to nature connectedness

> this meta-analysis primarily focused on hedonic measures of well-being.â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 3)

### Results show a significant and positive relationship between nature connection and happiness

This paper essentially outlined that there is a significant and positive relationship between nature connection and happiness. Essentially, the more connected to nature we feel, the (hedonically) happier we tend to feel. 

> The relationship between nature connectedness and happiness appears to be positive and significant. In general, individuals who are more connected to nature tend to be happierâ€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 10)

The degree of association between nature connection and happiness/wellbeing was so significant that it can be put on par with other significant happiness factors such as education, marital status, personality traits, physical attractiveness, etc. 

> Thus, a personâ€™s connection to nature should be considered an important construct when discussing happiness and vice versa.â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 11)

### Exposure to nature increases cognitive function

Exposure to nature not benefitted not only our emotional disposition but also increases cognitive function through the alleviation of cognitive fatigue, improved attention, and increased "feelings of vitality".
....  

> Beyond its ability to improve emotional functioning, exposure to natural environments has also been shown to alleviate cognitive fatigue, improve attention, and increase feelings of vitalityâ€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 10)

### The distress/pain of nature connection in a context of humanities harm of nature is compensated for with increases in other aspects of life, net positive

Increased nature connection in the context of humanities ongoing destruction of nature can be detrimental in some ways as it can and often does increase our sense of distress, pain, and concern as well as the degree of stress and effort we are compelled to put into pro-environmental behaviours. 

However, the other benefits of nature connection on the rest of our lives compensates for these detriments such that nature connection provides and overall net benefit to people. 


> that although some aspects of the human-nature relationship have the potential to detract from our happiness (e.g., some pro-environmental behaviors), other aspects may compensate and result in a net increase (e.g., a subjective connection to and contact with nature)â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 12)

  
....  

### We tend to misperceive the potential benefits of being in nature before we get out there and miss out


> Research suggests that individuals tend to commit affective forecasting errors and underestimate the hedonic benefits that being in nature will bring themâ€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 12)
