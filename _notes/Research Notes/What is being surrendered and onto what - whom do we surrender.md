**What is being surrendered and onto what/whom do we surrender**

It is not that one surrenders to the feelings that are arising within our psychedelic experiences, but that one surrenders those feelings onto something larger than themselves.

Fear for example. It is not that I surrender to my fear, I surrender my fear onto the larger force of that which holds me in my experience. Be that the spirit of the plant/fungi, God, Self-energy, or one innate healing intelligence, etc.

The larger question in this process then, when it comes to the challenge of surrender in the face of that which is being called to be surrendered, is not so much *what* is being surrendered, but onto to whom/what that *what* is being surrendered. 

Without this sense of the whom/what, the experience can often be that it is the feelings themselves we are surrendering to, which can climb in difficulty and loop into anxiety.
