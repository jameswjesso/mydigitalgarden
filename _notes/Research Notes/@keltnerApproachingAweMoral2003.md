##### The two features of awe: vastness and accommodation

Awe is an experience of sensory vastness, which can include a number of different expressions from physical size, complexity, degree of accomplishment or relative social status.

Accommodation infers that one's mental structures or models of reality need to be adjusted or changed in order to fit this experience into them.

> We propose that two features form the heart of prototypical cases of awe: vastness, and accommodation.

(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 303)

> Accommodation refers to the Piagetian process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience (Piaget & Inhelder, 1966/1969).


(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 304)
...

##### Experiences of awe diminish us in our personal sense of grandeur, this can be painful

Experiences of awe, as they diminish our sense of self, humble us, can be disorienting and even frightening as they can trigger in us a sense of powerlessness.

> We propose that prototypical awe involves a challenge to or negation of mental structures when they fail to make sense of an experience of something vast. Such experiences can be disorienting and even frightening, as in the cases of Arjuna and St. Paul, since they make the self feel small, powerless, and confused.

(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 304)

...

##### The accommodation is a need 

Accommodation of mental structures is a need in the face of the vast, which might be why it can be both terrifying and enlightening, depending on whether or not that accommodation is possible.  
  

> We stress that awe involves a need for accommodation, which may or may not be satisfied. The success of one's attempts at accommodation may partially explain why awe can be both terrifying 0when one fails to understand) and enlightening 0when one succeeds).

(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 304)

...

##### The presence of a sense of threat will flavour our awe experiences with fear
  
The presence of fear in the face of that which we stand in awe of flavours our experiences with a sense of threat.

Whether or not a fearful experience is still awe and not horror is explored [[@taylorAweHorrorDifferentiating2019|here]]

> . Threat. As discussed by Burke, threat and danger cause an experience of awe to be flavoured by feelings of fear. Variation in whether an entity is threatening or not might account for how charismatic leaders 0e.g., Hitler vs. Ghandi) or natural scenes 0e.g., an electrical storm vs. a sunset) evoke awerelated experiences of dramatically different valence.

(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 304)

...
##### Beauty as a combination of biophilla and an evolution of sexual desire

Beauty as an expression of our tendency towards biophillia (our desire to seek connection and closeness with nature and natural things) mixing with an evolution of our sexual desire and attraction impulses

> We cannot give here an account of what makes something beautiful, although we think it likely that there will be at least two sources of intuitions about beauty, one stemming from ``biophilia'' 0Wilson, 1984), and the other from the evolution of sexual desire and attraction 0Buss, 1994).
