>[!Abstract]
> Feeling connected to nature has been shown to be beneficial to wellbeing and pro-environmental behaviour. General nature contact and knowledge based activities are often used in an attempt to engage people with nature. However the specific routes to nature connectedness have not been examined systematically. Two online surveys (total n = 321) of engagement with, and value of, nature activities structured around the nine values of the Biophila Hypothesis were conducted. Contact, emotion, meaning, and compassion, with the latter mediated by engagement with natural beauty, were predictors of connection with nature, yet knowledge based activities were not. In a third study (n = 72), a walking intervention with activities operationalising the identified predictors, was found to significantly increase connection to nature when compared to walking in nature alone or walking in and engaging with the built environment. The findings indicate that contact, emotion, meaning, compassion, and beauty are pathways for improving nature connectedness. The pathways also provide alternative values and frames to the traditional knowledge and identification routes often used by organisations when engaging the public with nature.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> They studied the different means by which we can increase our nature connection broadly, based on some remapped Biophilia values. The remapped/renames values were contact, emotion, meaning, compassion, and beauty. 
> 
> They found that all of these are routes or pathways to greater nature connection, although beauty itself was not a direct path but a mediating factor. 
> 
> Though this they were able to show that simply being in nature (physical proximity) isn't enough to increase nature connection, but being in nature in such as a way that we connect with it through activities that travel us along the connection pathways of contact, meaning, emotion, or compassion (with beauty as a mediator) can increase nature connection.

## Notes


### The Biophilia Hypothesis

Biophilia hypothesis is about how humanity has been shaped cognitively and emotionally by their long evolutionary history in connection and immersion in nature. That our evolution supported an emotion inclination towards reverence and awe and wonder towards nature, and this inclination was tied to our 


> Humanity has thus been shaped both cognitively and emotionally over time through interactions with nature [13], leading to the development of a need and desire to affiliate with life or lifelike processes known as the Biophilia Hypothesisâ€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 2)
....  
> The emotional bond expressed unconsciously through biophilia leads to a reverence for nature that incorporates awe and wonder, with this reverence creating a love for life and the complexity of nature [16]. It has been suggested that this affiliation or love for life was essential for survival and often sought after by humanityâ€™s ancestorsâ€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 2)

  

  
....  

### The difference between nature relatedness and nature connection

Whereas nature relatedness is a measure of personality and identity constructs, nature connectedness encompasses a wider spread of the person, that includes personal and social influences AND cognitive, affective, learnt, experiential and personality factors

> Nature connectedness is subject to personal and social influences [35] and is comprised of cognitive [36], affective [37], learnt, experiential [22]and personality factors [38] that together, create a connection with nature.â€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 3)
...
> The Nature Relatedness scale (NR) is a measure of an individualâ€™s trait connection to nature.â€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 6)

  
....

### The 3 subdomains of nature relatedness, statement examples

This was flushed out in another note: [[@forstmannLifetimeExperienceClassic2017#The 3 Sub-dimension of Nature Relatedness]] but the quote below presents statements that encapsulate each subdomain.

> NR contains 3 factors: self (â€˜I am very aware of environmental issues), experience (â€˜I donâ€™t often go out in natureâ€™) and perspective (â€˜I think a lot about the suffering of animalsâ€™)â€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 6)


  
....  
### Values of biophilia hypothesis, renamed

There are 9 values of the biophilia hypothesis, this paper used 5 of them, but renamed them to the following:

- naturalistic â†’ contact
- humanistic â†’ emotion
- moralistic â†’ compassion
- aesthetic â†’ beauty
- symbolic â†’ meaning

> The naturalistic value was renamed contact; the humanistic, emotion; the moralistic, compassion; the aesthetic, beauty; and the symbolic, meaning.â€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 16)

Their reasoning for this was that their research was not about Biophilia Hypothesis, but nature connection broadly. 

> As nature connection was the focus of the research rather than the expression of the nine values of biophilia, the significant predictors have been renamed to distinguish them from the biophilic values, in the hope of facilitating their applied use and ease of understanding for the general publicâ€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 16) 

#### Definition of Each Value, matched to original name

- Contact: the act of engaging nature through the senses
- Beauty: the perception of aesthetic qualities including shape colour and form that please the senses
- Meaning: using nature or natural symbolism to communicate a concept that is not directly expressed
- Emotion: An affective state or sensation that occurs as a result of engaging with nature
- Compassion: extending this self to include nature leading to a concern for other natural entities that motivates understanding and helping/co-operation

### Simply walking in nature did not increase nature connectedness, walk in nature plus contact activities did.  

Simply walking in nature did not increase nature connectedness, however the walk in nature plus contact activities did.  
  
This is in opposition to other research that suggested a simple walk does as presented in [[@nisbetNatureRelatednessSubjective2014#The wellbeing effects of nature don't require wilderness, urban green spaces]]

> The finding that the pathway activity condition led to a significant increase in connection to nature is as hypothesized. It was predicted that this increase would be more than the nature control condition, but the walk in nature did not lead to an increase in nature connectedness, as might have been expected from previous research [34]. ==The combined results suggest that the physical walk had no effect on the increase in nature connectedness in the pathway activity condition, nor does a short walk in nature. Whereas, the enhanced contact with nature, enhanced by sensory and emotional activities, in the intervention condition was effective.== The significant increase in nature connectedness in the pathway condition supports the proposal that contact, emotion, meaning, and compassion, mediated by engagement with natural beauty, are pathways to nature connectedness.â€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 19)
....  
> The results of this study suggest that it is possible to increase the sensation of nature connectedness within an urban environment [51] but that the type of interaction with nature is important, given that merely walking in a natural setting did not increase nature connectedness.â€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 20)

....  
### Beauty/aesthetics is not a direct path to nature connectedness, mediates relationship

Beauty/aesthetics is not a direct path to nature connectedness but seems to play an important role in mediating that relationship through its impact on the compassion element of nature connectedness.  


> Returning to the cross-sectional studies, it was surprising that the aesthetic value (beauty)did not emerge as a direct predictor of nature connectedness in either study 1 or study 2. More interestingly, engagement with natureâ€™s aesthetics was found to consistently mediate the relationship between the moralistic (compassion) value and nature connectedness. This mediation supports recent work on the importance of engagement with natural aesthetics [8]. It appears that the appreciation of the aesthetics of nature is an important part of the relationship between the pathways and nature connectednessâ€”(Lumber et al., 2017, p. 20)
