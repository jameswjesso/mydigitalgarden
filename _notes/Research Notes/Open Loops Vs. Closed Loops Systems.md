**A closed loop system** is where everything within that system stays within the functioning operation of that system, cycling throughout it in as various states. Nothing piles up without eventual alternative function. 

It is essentially a system where the entropy created by that systems operation can be dumped back into the system for de- and re-composition

Nature is a closed loop system, everything within nature is eventually decomposed and recycled back into various states and functions elsewhere. 

For example, living bodies are composed of the materials of the land and decompose back into the materials of the land by way of feeding various other forms of life, from which other living bodies are composed. We can see another such example with poop.

**An open loop system** is one where elements of that system can be lost from the system. The results of the entropy from that system has nowhere to go, so they pile up without function or capacity for de- or re-composition. Eventually, this puts increased pressure on that system, and the other systems within which that open-loop system is nested.

Much of the human consumer world is an expression of open loop systems, such as plastic or landfills in general. Eventually, where does the plastic/garbage go? It just piles up, and we eventually run out of space to put it. And/or it leaks into other systems that also lack a capacity to de- and re-compose that entropy and puts pressure onto those systems, such as the effects of plastic on various life-forms and the water table.

Another example would be p-fast chemicals which can never decompose and just pile up in the bodies (systems) of the various forms of life in the systems adjacent/nested to human chemical waste (such as waterways, marine life, birds, etc).

Another example would be fossil fuels and the effects excess carbon and other atmosphere pollutants on various systems of life
