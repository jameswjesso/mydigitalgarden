# Notes

## Themes

##### From Eden to Eden

As life begins with a primal separation from the Other (out of the womb and progressively from the breast to the world on our own) we seek to go back to the Eden of being back in that primal Connection.

##### The Eden Project is a double meaning title.

It means the project we undergo to attempt to make the Other the source of our Eden experience (the being that takes us back to the undifferentiated perfection of the womb) and who will make it so that we don't actually have to do any of our own work of individuation and owning our shadow. 

It also means project as in projection, wherein we are projecting onto the Other the capacity to be or Eden.

##### Parents are primal Others and thus become primal imagos

As our parents are the foundational Others in our development, the primal Others who meet (or don't meet) our primal needs, the shape they take out of our childhood/infancy becomes the imagos (a kind of scheme or model or collection of hypothesis) by which we then perceive and engage Other in our lives. These imagos are very potent as they are very deeply set in ourselves, and are activated with our primal needs on the table. 


##### The Shaping of Eros 

Whereas Eros is about much more than sexual [[desire]], but the "desire for connection" (pg 34) and that we seek that connection through the Other (be it a person, place, thing, or process.... "mortal or immortal" (pg 33). The shape of our personal eros is an expression of:

- the example our parental imagos in the context of our socio-cultural context;
- the wounding our parents left us with and the degree to which we have healed; 
- the impact the latter two have had in our choices throughout life, in dynamic our socio-cultural context, to the creation of our patterns of personality, perception, and relationship.



### Chapter 1 - The Lost Garden: Acquiring a sense of Self

##### The [[Self]] is an unknowable process, not object nor goal, and the best we can actually achieve in its knowing is a [[sense of self]]. The rest is properly Mystery.

> “The Self, Like God, Is essentially unknowable. So one must speak both of the mystery of God and the mystery of Self. The Self is not an object or even a goal, but an activity, a process. […] Hence the fragile ego must content itself with “a sense” of Self, the Self forever unknown, unknowable. - pg16


##### Jung saw the mind in terms of Multiplicity 

It seems, according to the descriptions of Hollis, that Jung saw the Self and the psyche as being of multiplicity. This is clear on pg 16 when he speaks to the “depth, breadth, and multiplicity of the Self” and on pg 31 when he said that Jungians do not see the psyche as "a monarchy, as the ego would have it, or even as a central intelligence agency, but rather as an entity that is polyfaceted, polymorphous, polysemous, polytheistic."

##### We all have wounds (or they have us) and around those wounds are clusters or energy called complexes.

> We have wounds, and the clusters of energy that accompanied them, because we have a life history. The deeper question is whether we have wounds or they have us. pg 21.

##### Complexes, once activated, usurp the higher controls or perception and response, altering our sense of reality. 

.....

##### Our parental complexes are extremely influence on us because of how foundational they are in our psyche.

> Such complexes, especially the parental imagos, are affectively charged images that have a unique, historically generated and discrete energy. When activated, they have the power to usurp the ego position and totally alter one sense of reality. The parental complexes are usually the most influential because they constitute the original experience of relationship, and remain its chief paradigm. Again, because of the subjective misreading of these primal relationship, the power of the parental complex is to determine the character of subsequent relationships cannot be overstated. pg 21

##### Psycho-logic is a term to suggest that despite our illogical behaviour arising from activated complexes might seems objectively, there is always some kind of logical driving it. 

It is psycho-logic when it is being driven by activated complexes. The challenge, however, is to discern the affective state (the complex) that is driving these psycho-logical behaviours so as to not fall powerless to their reality altering drive.

> There is no such thing as a wholly illogical behavior. It is always logical, that is, psycho-logical—if we can discern the affective state out of which it has come. pg. 21

##### The two main categories or early life parental wounds is engulfment and abandonment, 

both of which come from a place of powerlessness to access the perfection of undifferentiated union experienced in the womb and lost upon entry into the word and forced separation into being an individual.

> From each mayflower radically different strategies. [] but []  underneath each is a common psycho-logic pg. 21

##### Ambition, productivity, and accomplishment as defence strategies against embedded wounds of powerlessness

> The driven person is never at peace with the soul common for the productivity is a defence against the angst of powerlessness. pg 24

##### We are not necessary doomed to repeat the patterns driven by childhood wounding. However...

However, in order to free ourselves, we must first experience them enough to recognize that they are patterns. Additionally, that recognition, requires a certain degree of stability in our sense of self (he describes as “ego-strength”) to be able to even reflect on these patterns; to adult in the presence of our childhood wounds. It usually isn’t until we are older that we have this, however age does not always produce this kind of adulting capacity as growing older does not necessarily mean growing into adults.

> Are we doomed to these patterns? Surely we are free to be intubated behave otherwise. Yes, but that requires a high degree of conscious awareness of the pattern, we can only know something is a pattern and we have done it several times. Moreover, until midlife or later we have seldom gained sufficient ego strength to reflect upon our choices. The young person is still too unconscious and cannot risk any self-doubt in the already shaky enterprise of life. Even ageing does not necessarily produce consciousness. pg 24

**Chapter 1 Summary** 

He explored how we are wounded in early life (starting with birth’s separation from unity), primarily by our parents’ wounds, and how our early wounds carry over into our adult relationships, as we seek out in each the Other what is needed to either play out the compensations/strategies we have to protect ourselves from those wounds, or the Other that we childishly hope will heal them from us by being the “being of love and connection” we didn’t get in childhood. Yet in all of this we lack the very basic self-awareness and maturity necessary to be with ourselves in healthy relationship, and thus we are even more sorely lacking in our capacity to be with each other in healthy relationship. At least, as long as we live under the conditions described.

> So we bring ourselves to relationship. With scant knowledge of ourselves, we seek are density in the mirror of the Other, as we once did in Mom and Dad. With all the wounds of this perilous condition we seek a safe harbour in that other food, alas, is seeking the same in us. With the thousand adaptive strategies derived from the fortuity's of faded time, treated place, foetid others, we can terminate the fair frail present with the germs of the past. We bring the immensity of the Cardinal’s project, the yearning to merge with the Other, the one who will protect, nurture and save us. pg 32

### Chapter 2 - Going Home: The Eden Project

This chapter seemed to deal with the questions of love vs marriage, and how the history of out modern society has conflated the two, will also loading both with unrealistic, religious-level expectations for liberation/competition to be given by the presence of our Beloved other. 

However, that excess baggage adds to an already loaded process by which we project onto the Other in ways that not only prevent us from truly seeing the other, but also block of actually loving them while simultaneously blocking us from knowing ourselves... that is, if we don't effort to catch and reclaim those projections. That act of reclamation and the learning that it enables in our [[Journey of Becoming]] and Being makes the context of intimate/love relationships are profound context for that journey. 

It is a profound context because the depth and breadth of potential (and likely) projection within the context of intimate/love relationship provides up ample opportunities for that learning, along with another with whom there is collaborative and mutually supportive efforts towards the reclamation of projection that allows for that learning.

#### This Crazy Thing Called Love

##### [[Marriage]] being about love is a 21st century ideal

For much of the history of the world as is written in the Western records, marriage was not about love or supporting the individual's wellbeing but about maintaining and protecting cultural values and order.

> historically, love and marriage have not been synonymous; contrary to that old song, they have seldom gone together "like a horse and carriage." As a matter of fact, only in the last century and a half has the vox populi claimed marriage and love as one in the same. This is not to say that happily committed people have not loved each other, but rather that for most of human history the purpose of marriage was to bring stability to the culture rather than make the individual happy or serve the task of mutual individuation. Possibly the greatest number of history's marriages would, by today's standards, be described as loveless, for they were contracted arrangements made to produce, protect and nurture the young, thus preserve the tribe, to transmit social and religious values, and to channel anarchic libido and socially useful directions. - pg 42


##### The modern search for Romantic Love through finding The One as a replacement for God and institutional religion  

> One may even suggest that romantic love has placed institutional religion as the greatest motive power and influence in our lives. [...] Almost all the popular songs express the "religiosity" of romantic love. Recall the etymology of the word religion—"to bind back to, reconnect with." Hithero we sought this in relationship with a supreme being; now we seek it through immersion in an Other. - pg. 43


###### [[Suicide]] in the tragic loss of love being an extension of extreme projection

When we have so fully projected onto the Other that they represent not only our exclusive path "home"—e.g. eden, return to the bliss of infancy/pre-birth—but even as far as that "One" being our "only", when they leave, then we become nothing with not path to becoming anything, and thus living no longer means anything other than inescapable suffering and death is a logical exit from that seemingly otherwise impossible to change scenario.

> suicide is a "logical" extension of the original unconscious premise: "my soul, my reality, is in the hands of that other." When the other is not there for me, or spurns me, or I feel blocked by extra newest forces, I suffer a loss of the sense of self. Without a sense of self I am miserable and, so the logic goes I shall kill myself last I lose myself. - pg 49

#### Withdrawing Projections

##### The 5 Stages of Projection 

**1 -** Unchecked projection, that which is being perceived is believed to be exclusively outside themselves, with no source of influence from within

>  first, a person is convinced that his or her inner experience is truly outer, for it is experienced "out there." - pg. 51

**2 -** There is a recognition of discrepancy between what one in projecting onto the Other and the reality of the Other or situation. There is an opening to the potential recognition of projection happening. 

>  The second stage of the projective process arises out of the often gradual perception of discrepancy, the widening golf between who the Other is supposed to be and our concrete experience. - pg 51

This can be a painful process both in the pending sense of loss of that which we thought was firm (e.g.such as when the ideal partner vision we projected onto someone begins to be threatened by who they actually are), but also in the conflicting feelings that arise in defence against their call to responsibility for one's projections, their roots, and their consequences. 

Often this results in a new projection to emerge wherein the Other is blamed or struggled against, now as the source of the pain of the discrepancy. 

**3 -** This is where we are obliged to reassess our projective perceptions and whatever new projections emerged as a consequence of the conflict arising from the pain of the discrepancies of the second stage, and then actually open ourselves to seeing who/what that which/whom we were projecting upon truly is.

> The third stage of the projective process, whether in or out of therapy, applied is the assessment of this new perception of the other. One's partner must now be seen a new. What is going on between us? Who, really, *is* he/she? - pg 52

**4 -** This is where we begin to accept that our projection-perceptions were not real in the sense that they were not about the Other but actually about ourselves. This is the stage where we are called to ownership of ourselves, and in doing so liberate the other of the emotional burden of labouring on behalf of our unowned emotions. 

> The fourth stage leads one to recognize that what one perceived was not actually real, that one was not experiencing the Other out there, but the Other in here. This step represents an act of ethical courage for helps to lift the cosmic project off the shoulders of the Other. - pg 52

**5 -** This is where we endeavour to inquire and discover the root, the source of the projection, its meaning, and its purpose. To make the projected unconscious, consciously owned.

> The fifth stage requires the search for the origin of that projected energy within oneself. This is to ask for the meaning of the projection. Which part of me was projected, and to what end? Since projections are by definition originally unconscious, we can only withdraw them once we have sustained the suffering of discrepancy. - pg. 52

##### The 3 ways to help detect Projection

**1 -** There are certain contexts wherein certain projections are more likely to emerge than others. If in one of those contexts, we are well-served by keeping in mind the high likelihood of projection happening.

- E.g. unconscious/highly-energized complexes of affect relating to authority are likely to emerge when one is interacting with an authority figure, or where one is required to submit themselves to power-over.
- OR - In romantic relationships, wherein the context often calls out of us the unconscious dynamics/emotional energies leftover from our childhood and infantile relationships with our parents (and of them with each other)

**2 -** Projection can also be experienced physically, wherein body reactions might occur that indicated a substantial process is being activated. 

> secondly, we may experience projection in a physical way. A churning stomach, a quickening hard, sweaty palms and so on or somatic states that can alert us to the likelihood of projection. - pg 53

How to differentiate that from an acute "gut-feeling" or intuition is a nuanced dance, requires the kind of self-knowledge and capacity for self-inquiry that the 4th and 5th stage of projection helps up engender. 

**3 -** The amount of energy being expressed/discharged in projection is always more than the actual situation warrants. That is to say that if we are having a strong reaction, it's possible we are over reacting, and if we are over reacting then we are projecting. 

> thirdly, in projection the quantity of energy discharge is always disproportionate to the situation. - pg 53

Again, being able to differentiate between appropriately strong reaction and over-reaction is a skill that is developed through the 4th and 5th stage of projection, as well as the general development of what Gabor Mate calls emotional Competence.

[[Emotional Competence]]


##### Dealing with projections is the chief burden of any intimate relationship

The capacity for any intimate relationship to make it, in the sense of becoming longterm sustainable and healthy, is for both parties to be willing to take and be supportive of each other taking responsibility for our projections as far down into the discovery and ownership levels of the 4th and 5th stages of projection.

The main burden relationships will struggle with is this mutually supportive discovery and ownership. This is because, though simple, it is far from easy to do. It challenged both because of an in-baked, wound-protective resistance to touching those places within ourselves from where are projections arise; and from the the sheer "immensity of the project" as there is and forever will be more unconscious material that will arise, and it is easy to want to throw up are hands at what can seem like a Sisyphean ordeal. The latter reason likely be an extension of the former.

> Ultimately, the health and hope of any intimate relationship will depend on each party's willingness to assume responsibility for the vertical access [in reference to diagram from this chapter, on page 47], the relationship to one's own unconscious material. Sounds logical, even easy, nothing is more difficult. The chief burden on any relationship derives both from our unwillingness to assume responsibility and from the immensity of the project. It takes great courage to ask this fundamental question: "What am I asking of this Other that I ought be doing for myself?"
>- pg 57

##### The transcendent third in relationship; relationship as spiritual practice

The transcendent or reconciling third is the building of a third part, the relationship, which itself can act as a kind of access and expression of [[cosmic-level]] and [[Being level]]. 

The love cultivated then becomes a kind of cosmic Other with whom we can be in conversation through being in conversation with each other and ourselves in the context of that third. 

A cosmic-*something* that can hold us in relationship, and through relationship we can touch within ourselves and with each other. A cosmic-*something* that encourages and enables a process of learning and becoming that builds a life with depth of meaning. (Thus relationships can be a kind of spiritual practice)

> This mediating third is how relationship truly serves us, and bring us to what Jung called a symbolic life. We live the symbolic life as a direct consequence of the quality our dialogue with the world and with the cosmos. My dialogue with you is my dialogue with the cosmos, for you carry and incarnate those same energies. You oblige me to consider, to reflect, to grow, to enlarge my sense of the possible, and thereby expand my embodiment of what the Self requires. We are asked from birth to death to become as fully as possible that which we are capable of becoming. Living in a dialectic with you, I am then living the symbolic life, which is to say, a life in depth. - pg 59


##### To open ourselves to love is to open ourselves to suffering

To open ourselves to love is to open ourselves to suffering, but to chose to not suffer is to chose a hollow life.

> Thus, Cupid dashes still with sagging diaper, bow and arrow. Arrows hurt, yet wounds quicken consciousness. To love the Other is to feel that wound, to care about what happens to and for that person. So many of our words, such as compassion, empathy, sympathy, come from *passio* and *pathos*, Latin and Greek words for "suffering." Thus, to open to the Other is also a willingness to open ourselves to the experience of suffering. Who is not willing to suffer, as Goeth suggested, is only a troubled guest on the Earth. To be really here, on this Earth, is to experience its *gravitas*.


### Chapter 3 - Couples, Coupling and Uncoupling.

This chapter focused heavily on the role of fear in relationships, fear of taking responsibility for our own individuation and what we need to own in/face about ourselves in the process. 

##### The 4 fears in relationship: closeness, distance, change, permeance. 

Hollis describes the works of Fritz Riemann and their description of the 4 main fears in relationship. These are ultimately unconscious, and are unlikely to be seen and owned until they are expressed in a way that reveals themselves, through how we defend against them as we fall into the problem of power and, again, usually at the expense of the Other at first.

> 1. The fear of nearness of lightest distancing. In its extreme form it is a schizoid splitting off from the Other.  
> 2. The fear of distance occasions an existential depression, which may go undiagnosed, so deep is its course. The depression derives from the absence of the other, the terror of abandonment.  
> 3. The fear of change obliges wanting to be obsessive-compulsive, to seek control, if not of the Other, then of those circumstances that offer the illusion of control such as one's own body image, the tidiness of one's house, or a frenetic attention to closure in all matters, whether in important or mundane.
> 4. The fear of permanence, which means the two closeness of the other – that is, the fear of engulfment – occasions what Riemann cause hysteria. In this sense, hysteria is the capacity to dissociate, to transfer one fear into the body, to remain effectively flat or inappropriate, or simply to be "not there." After all if one is "not there," one can't be hurt, can one?
> - pg 70-71

##### The erosion of projection can create problems of power

Once our projections onto the Other (such as them being that which will do our individuation work for us by providing us the return to wholeness we experienced before our entry into individual life, e.g. womb and infancy) begin to fade, there is a distress that arises and can express in various forms, but is ultimately fear and in the management of that fear there is a grasping for power. Power to evade and replace our fears with issues other than what we are actually afraid of; facing ourselves. A power of control; controlling the other, controlling how much we let ourselves be seen or see ourselves, controlling the narrative for who is at fault for our feelings, etc.


##### Power itself is not a problem, but how and by whom it is used can be problematic

He states that it isn't power itself that is a problem, but it is problematic when that power is being used by a complex (e.g. a blended protector part) or when it is being used in a way that exploitive of the Other. 

> Power itself is not a problem; in and of itself, it is only the exchange or expression of energy. It becomes problematic when it is usurped by a complex, or exploited at the expense of the Other. -pg 67

##### It is normal to feel fear in relationship, those fears are universal, and facing them is challenging for everyone.

There is no need to judge ourselves for feeling these fears, or even for falling into them at first encounter. However, these fears have strategic defences associated to them so deep they are essentially woven into our personality, and the inevitability is that those defences, in relationships, will express in ways that harm the Other. However, we can mitigate that harm by becoming as conscious of who we are, and our fears, and how deeply programmed into us our defensive strategies are, and then owning those aspects of ourselves that takes responsibility of holding their harmful impact off the Other

> Such fears are existential and universal – the fear of abandonment, the fear of overwhelming, the fear of meaninglessness. We should not judge these fears, for they come with the territory, so to speak. But our vastly elaborate defences against them, are reticulated reflexes which constitute the operative personality, always impose themselves upon the integrity of the Other. Just by being who we are, unavoidably who we are, with all our foibles and fragilities, we harm the Other. And we cannot help doing that, the more so we are unconscious of who we are, what we fear, and how deeply programmed our our strategies of relationship. - pg 68

##### The 4 principles of relationship

Based on the central these of the book, which is that that the healthiest we can be in relationship with an Other is determined by how healthy we can be in relationship with ourselves.

> 1. Whatever we do not know about ourselves (unconscious project) or will not face in ourselves (the shadow), will be projected onto the Other
> 2. We project our childhood wounding (personal pathology), or infantile logging (the narcissistic going home agenda), and our individuation imperative onto the other.
> 3. Since the Other cannot, and should not, bear responsibility for our wounds, our narcissism or our individuation, the projection gives away to resentment and the problem of power.
> 4. The only way to heal a faltering relationship is to render are going home project conscious and take personal responsibility for individuation
-- pg. 74

##### The challenge of recognizing the unconscious expressing so as to own it

With respect to 1. this means be have to learn to recognize and own ourselves and our shadow, which is very challenging but absolutely necessary for a healthy relationship. Doing so means learning how to recognize moments when that unconscious material is being expressed, eg. in fears and defences and grasps for power, and when affect is heightened. 

> Making the unconscious conscious, owning our own charged material, is an extraordinarily difficult task, no matter how willing we may be. We make the unconscious conscious by examining our patterns, not only in the present but in our whole history of relationships. We watch for when and where we are most charge, that is, times when complexes most commonly surface. -- 76


##### Taking responsibility for our own suffering so as to make it a a source of meaning

This is similar to my concept of authentic vs reactive suffering. 

> Jung observed that "neurotic suffering is an unconscious fraud and has no moral merit, as has real suffering." Elsewhere he writes that a neurosis, "must be understood, ultimately, as the suffering of a soul which has not discovered its meaning." Just so, we are obliged to take responsibility for our suffering in the task meeting which is occasions. -- 79


##### Although we are ultimately on our own to walk the path of being/becoming ourselves in this life, we are not wholly alone as our aloneness can be shared with others 

Although we are on our own to walk the path of being/becoming ourselves in this life, we are not wholly alone as our aloneness can be shared with others. 

> We are not wholly alone. The road is filled with others like us. We may offer each other in encouragement, compassion, even great assistance, but we cannot take on another's journey any more than another can die our death for us. If they cannot die our death, why should they live our lives? Is not the meaning of being here tied to our becoming whatever the gods, our nature, intended? - pg 83

([[dying]])

.....

##### [[Marriage]] is not about [[romance]] or [[happiness]], but about transformation

> "I think one of the problems in marriage is that people don't realize what it is. They think it's a love affair and it isn't. Marriage has nothing to do with being happy. It has to do with being transformed, and when the transformation is realize it is a magnificent experience. But you have to submit. You have to yield. You have to give. You can't just dictate."  (From Joseph Campbell, This Business Of The Gods, p 85)


### Chapter 4 - Becoming Conscious of Eros Wounds 


##### Loosing sexual attraction to partner in midlife due to them resembling your parent as they were when you were a child

Hollis presents that often men (and I presume also women) begin to lose sexual attraction to their partner in midlife as they begin to be visually similar to the representation of our parental imago (the image we have of our parents from childhood).  

Although what having that parent might represent is desirable, it is also "activates the incest taboo." There is a fear of incest as it represents  powerlessness and "regression into infantile dependencies" and so our partners become (unconsciously) desexualized to protect from that.  -- pg 90



##### The degree to which we can heal ourselves is the degree to which we are willing to see and own our unconscious...

The degree to which we can heal ourselves is the degree to which we are willing to see and own our unconscious, its expressions, roots, consequences. 

> The measure of our possible healing is the extent of our willingness and capacity to face such wounds, or unconscious patterns, and our deepest desires. -- pg 89


##### **.***.** Carrying each other's animus/anima in relationship through projection

Hollis proposes that one of the ways in which the Eden project unfolds in relationship is to have the other carry (in the form of projection) all the responsibility and burden of our inner anima/animus. 

Recognizing this projection and owning it as a part of our individuation frees the Other of that responsibility, increasing our capacity to heal and mature, as well as allowing our Other/partner to do the same unburdened by our projections of who/how they need be to meet our un-owned and unresolved internal issues.

And, being that this is usually a dynamic dance, the vice versa (not engaging in counter-transference) also forces them to deal with their own which, though painful, is important for their own individuation/healing journey as much as our own.

##### Neurosis is an offended god / [[suffering]] from archetypal denial

With respect to neurosis being a kind of self-igniting, exacerbating and reiterating patterned pain/fear/defence/behaviour=suffering loop, Jung proposed that this loop is a kind of offended god.

By this he means that a god is a "dramatization" (I would use personification) of an archetypal force that moves through us, and it's offence results in neurosis as  not showing up to care for and give expression to the archetypal force it represents within ourselves is tantamount to not feeling into the authentic pain of being and the self-igniting, exacerbating and reiterating patterned pain/fear/defence/behaviour=suffering loop that results.


> when Jung observed that a neurosis is like an offended god, he meant that a god is the dramatization of a certain archetypal energy, the neglect or abuse of which occasions considerable suffering. To neglect or offend a God is ultimately to bond ourselves, for the gods represent the forces of nature of the course through us


##### The Necessary Questions We Need to Ask Ourselves in Relationship (in order to dispel projection and recognize/own our unconscious)

> 1. Where do my dependencies show up in the relationship?  
> 2. What am I asking my partner to do for me that I, as a mature adult, need to be doing for myself? 
> 3. How do I repeatedly constrict myself through my historically condition attitudes and behaviour patterns? 
> 4. Am I taking too much responsibility for the emotional well-being of the other? Am I taking on his or her journey at the expense of my own, and if so, why? 
> 5. Am I living my life in such a fashion that I will be happy with the consequences of my choices? If not, when do I plan to start? What fears, lack of permission or old behaviours block me from living my life? 
> 6. In what ways do I seek to avoid suffering?



## Chapter 5 - Eros in Organizations

This chapter focused on exploring how the psychological and soulful underpinnings that drive our eden project in romantic relationship unfold in various scales and contexts of organizations; and how our unowned and unseen elements of our unconscious drives, complexes, and general shadow material influence the functioning of that/those organization(s) and the various manners of projection and dysfunction that unfold in the relationships within that organization at all levels of whatever hierarchy it maintains. Most primarily, it focuses on exploring the workplace, but also looked at academia, and social institutions in general.

The general principal was something to the effect of how the shared set of purposes that hold together our society, namely capitalist consumerism, dismantles the common transcendent experince that would allow up the capacity to transform ourselves for the better in our various organizations, and instead become soulless (and [[@hollisEdenProjectSearch1998#The loss of soul makes institutions demonic|demonic]]) cesspools of immaturity, psychopathology, and neurosis—places where, by his words, we "suffer the consequences of someone else's unexamined life." (pg 109)

##### The loss of soul makes institutions demonic

With respect to an institutions being bereft of a common transcendent experince that allows for a community that holds the soul's worth, care, and the beings transformation within that institution of merit, organizations become distorted and contorted to serve purposes that offend and wound the soul of humanity, and through humanity the world as we know it. Making them demonic.

> Even a good idea becomes demonic when it becomes one-sided, exclusive, and resistant to dialogue. - pg 107



##### **...** Parts are personified complexes

Jungian autonomous complexes are clusters of emotionally charged images and ideas that are developed throughout our live experiences, and are grown or reduced or altered by way of how our lives (and our relationship to those complexes) effect their expression over time. They are autonomous as they exist without our control or conscious effort, and various scenarios and events  in life can trigger their activation (and thus potentially distort our perception of that scenario/event due to the complex working as a lens through which it is perceived, e.g. through projection). 

The process of working with these complexes in a way that helps shift/alter their disposition and charge is the process of making the unconscious conscious—such as [[@hollisEdenProjectSearch1998#The 5 Stages of Projection|progressing through the 5 stages of projection]]—and then working with those activations in effective ways.

Being that [[@Healing Trauma with Frank Anderson and Matthias Barker#Personified aspects Peopled model of thinking|IFS parts work is essentially the personification of our thinking mind]] perhaps we could say that IFS is the personification of complexes so as to work with them. Wherein that personification gives them a kind of animate expression of personhood that enables relationship building and a more effective working process with them. Or, alternatively, that personification is actually a corrective action to liberate them from the flatlander life forced upon them by incomplete and inaccurate models of regard. 

*This idea needs more flushing out as I am not certain I truly know enough about complexes to say for sure.



##### The Loss of Eros in Academia Is a Loss of the Transcendent yearning to Learn

Moved to single note....

[[The Loss of Eros in Academia Is a Loss of the Transcendent yearning to Learn]]


##### Living life fully means letting life in and putting life into what we do

Living life fully means letting life in more deeply, and putting your life more fully into the world.... which means knowing what  that life is in our selves—in all its forms, pleasant and painful—having access to it and then brining that full experience of life into our lives and what we do and allowing our full life to be seen by those we trust and love.

##### The Self carries the god-imago

> The internal carrier of the god-imago is what Jung called the Self - pg 122

What Hollis is pointing to here is that we carry an imago (model/representation) for God bases on our sociocultural upbringing, similar to the imagos we carry for our parents based on our familial upbringing (which is of course nested within a sociocultural context). Whereas our parental imagos play a carrying/container/shaping role for our longing towards the romantic Other 

*^^^^ you know, as I attempt to write this out, I genuinely don't think I understand it. I am gonna step back from it now.*

##### We find our way to the Self through the conflict 

Self is the internal iteration of the archetypal form of the wholeness of Mystery. That Mystery is beyond compartmentalization of its constitute parts and their oppositions, meaning that it contains its own opposites as a matter of its existence. Whatever its truth is, its opposites are also true. 

Hollis here is suggesting that the ultimate Truth of that Mystery cannot be known, but we can know the polarities between its opposites and the conflict that arises in our confrontation of the polarities of those opposites. That conflict is an avenue by which we can experience the Self—wholeness' internal representation—as our encounter with that conflict is our encounter with the smaller self touching Mystery as Self.....(I think)

> "The self is made manifest in opposites and in the conflict between them.... Hence the way to the self begins with conflict." - pg 122, (a quote from Psychology and Alchemy, CW 12, par. 259)


##### Disconnecting ourselves from Mystery/God by mistaking of image of it as being it

Just as the symbols through we experience archetypes are not the archetypes themselves. Neither is the image we experince as God, our internal representation for what/who he/it is, actually God.  When we forget that and begin to worship our image of God, we lose our connection to the realm of Mystery from which our very sense of God emerges. The result being that we loose that sense, that connection to Mystery, and replace it with a false one forged out of "the nervous ego's desire for security".

**QUOTE** -- 

> As we know, imagos that express the deep movement of soul can also reify, grow brittle, even die. **We need to remember that the image is not the God; rather, it is the vehicle of the godly. It seems the common temptation of us all to adore the image rather than the Mystery to which it points. Such a mistaken relationship becomes the sin of idolatry, arising out of our anxious attempt to freeze, to hold onto, the Mystery.** When we seek to fix it on behalf of the nervous ego's desire for security, we blaspheme, for we are seeking to limit the autonomy of Mystery. -- pg 127 emphasis mine

I spoke to this issue in a draft of Deep Learning, where I has said that *"once we consider it known, it is no longer mysterious and whatever that something best described as an intelligent other was, disintegrates from view, unrealizedly replaced in our mind with nothing more than an inanimate conceptual approximation...Some things in life aren’t served by attempting to dominate them with our certainty of knowing, and the full Mystery of psilocybin and is one of those things."



##### The importance of Spirituality in relationship

If our spirituality is the means by which we live out our connection to the Mystery, as manifest in wholeness as the archetype of the Self, which is an organizing principle of the psyche that transcends the ego self. Then our spirituality also contributor to the presence or absence of that organizing principle in our manner or and engagement with relationship 

This quotes from the last of 5 questions he invites us to ask ourselves in order to expand beyond a self-limited narrow horizon of spirituality.

> Our spirituality is the most critical field of relationship, for from the quality of our spirituality comes the tenor and outcome of all other relationships. - pg 131
