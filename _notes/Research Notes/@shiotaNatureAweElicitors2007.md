## Notes  
(2023-03-13, 1:51:20 p.m.)

##### Awe is an emotional response to be confronted by something so vast that it overwhelms our sense of what's real and possible.

> an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that overwhelm current mental structures,  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 944)  

...

##### The two features of awe

Two features, perceptual vastness and need for accommodation, which is to say that it is beyond what we thought possible but with a sense that it is valuable and worth of shifting our sense of what's possible to include it.

> Keltner and Haidt (2003) proposed that awe-eliciting stimuli are characterised by two features: perceptual vastness and need for accommodation  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 945)  

...

##### Why psilocybin-induced experiences of awe and the purpose of integration

With respect to psilocybin, the awe-inducing encounters with that which overwhelms our models demands a kind of revamping of those models to include it... this is the purpose of integration.

[[Psilocybin-induced experiences of awe and the purpose of integration|note here]]

> According to Piagetian theories of cognition people understand the world through mental representations of experience, or schemas, conserved in the face of continual changes in the environment (Piaget, 1970; Siegler, 1998). The process of assimilation involves interpreting present stimuli as additional cases of existing schemas. By contrast, in the process of accommodation, attention is focused on deviations of the present stimulus from existing schemas, and schemas are updated or created anew to take these deviations into account (Fiedler, 2001; Piaget, 1970, 1973).  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 946)  

...

##### Awe is oriented to a vastness beyond us, and thus humbles us 

Awe is oriented to a vastness beyond us, thus is is not self-enhancing but humbling.

> the thoughts and feelings accompanying prototypical awe experiences should be stimulus-focused and self-diminishing, emphasising the perception of greatness outside the self, rather than self-focused and self-enhancing.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 946)  

...
##### Happiness is social, smiling is a social cue for attraction

Happiness is elicited by pleasurable interaction with loved ones.  
  
It is organic that people smile when they are happy.  
  
Smiling is a kind of social cue to attract others to interact.It is often that smiling people are rated as more attractive than those with a neutral face.  
  
Smiling also cues to the interaction partner that one is valuing the interaction, and that the relationship is "valued and worthy of investment"

> Second, people smile when they are happy. Happiness is distinctively accompanied by the Duchenne smile, which includes contraction of the muscles surrounding the eyes as well as movement of the lip corners upward (Ekman et al., 1987). The Duchenne smile is also associated by participants worldwide with reunion with loved ones (Ekman & Friesen, 1971). Both findings point to the highly social nature of happiness. One major function of smiling is to attract social interaction partners; observers typically find smiling people more attractive than deadpan ones, and smiling is associated with positive social outcomes throughout adulthood (Harker & Keltner, 2001; LaFrance & Hecht, 1995; Reis et al., 1990). Smiling indicates to the interaction partner, and felt happiness to the agent, that a relationship is valued and worthy of investment (Gonzaga, Keltner, Londahl, & Smith, 2001; Shiota, Campos, Keltner, & Hertenstein, 2004)  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 947)  

...

##### Those in a state of awe are less likely to smile. 

Those in a state of awe are less likely to smile. The proposition is that this is because smiling is a result of happiness, which is generally a social experience, and awe is generally not social but an encounter with something beyond us

> Participants in the happiness condition were significantly more likely to report smiling than those in the awe condition.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 949)  

...
##### awe related to social stimuli is less about the relationship but the transition the other is going through
 
awe related to social stimuli is less about the relationship but the transition the other is going through, eg. birth, death, career change or accomplishment, etc

> The few social events reported as awe elicitors involved a major life transition for another person, such as a marriage or a death; in these descriptions participants placed less emphasis on the relationship, and more on the transition.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 950)  

...

##### Awe is induced by Experiences that challenge our sense of reality 

> that experiences that challenge an individual’s normal frame of reference, or way of thinking about the world, will tend to evoke awe.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 950)  

...

##### Awe is always interpreted as positive.  
  
Modern research into awe, however, reveals awe to be generally interrupted as a positive experience. However, this is not a universal definition, as the inclusion of fear is present in other definitions academic and otherwise. -- Thus the fear that we speak of in reverence, is not the kind of fear....

see more on this issue here [[@taylorAweHorrorDifferentiating2019]]

> One striking feature of the awe-eliciting events described by participants is that all were interpreted as positive. The Keltner and Haidt (2003) definition leaves room for awe to be inspired by negative, threatening stimuli not accounted for by current knowledge structures, such as natural disasters, but such elicitors were not described by our participants.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 950)  

...

##### Awe and Horror are different

Awe and horror are different. The suggestion is that if fear is involved then events that would trigger awe are more likely to trigger horror.

> This might suggest that positive awe and negative horror are fundamentally different types of experience, with awe being inherently positive. One possibility is that appraisals of threat or loss override appraisals that would otherwise elicit awe; another is that horror is a blend of awe and fear.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 950)  

...

##### Most Modern Westerners experience awe from nature or fractals

Western, egalitarian societies are most likely to report awe from naturally occurring events and objects (objects especially that have repeating features, like fractals)

> Perhaps the most common experience of awe for people in egalitarian, Western societies (as for our sample in Study 1) is in response to massive natural entities, such as mountains, vistas, storms, and oceans, or to naturally occurring objects, like waves or fractals, with infinitely repeating patterns.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 951)  

...

##### Accomplishment and identification with culture

People reporting accomplishment tend to feel more connected with their respective culture. The proposition here is that this is because one's culture provide the framework by which one measures their accomplishment

> Participants describing accomplishments also reported feeling more connected with their cultures, perhaps because cultural values provide the standards by which we measure our own performance.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 954)  

...

##### dispositional awe-proneness have less needs for cognitive closure, and vice versa

Those who have dispositional awe-proneness have less need for cognitive closure, and vice verse for those that have higher need for cognitive closure.  
  
Could it be that triggering awe and/or cultivating less need for cognitive closure, practicing "wonder" and submission to mystery as a skill, support each other?

> Individuals high on Need for Cognitive Closure are uncomfortable with ambiguity, prefer continuity in their surroundings and in what is expected of them, and dislike situations that do not have a ‘‘correct’’ answer or response. Thus, we expected Need for Cognitive Closure to correlate negatively with dispositional awe-proneness.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 955)  


> This supports our hypothesis, derived from Keltner and Haidt’s (2003) proposed definition of awe, that awe-prone individuals should be especially comfortable revising their own mental structures, or acknowledging that currently held mental structures are not adequate to the occasion. This effect cannot be attributed to general effects of positive emotion, since Need for Cognitive Closure was not associated with dispositional Joy or Pride.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 958)  

...
#### awe-prone people tend to have self-concepts integrated into context beyond the self

Those with greater awe-proneness tend to have self-concepts that are more integrated into larger models of the self, such as those of the universal or of oneness with things. The self as a part of something greater than the self

> dispositional awe-proneness was associated with greater representation of ‘‘universals’’, or statements about membership in very large categories, in participants’ self-concepts.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 958)  

...

##### Awe-proneness and need for cognitive closure, uncertain if correlation is also causation

Their research suggests that although there is a correlation between awe-proneness and self-diminished within lager context self-concept and reduced need for cognitive closure, that awe experiences are not necessarily a cause of the latter two observations..... It actually did not explicitly test for this

> Results of Study 4 were consistent with those of Study 3, finding that experimentally elicited awe led to increased representation of membership in ‘‘universal’’ categories in the self-concept. This effect was not found for statements about personal value or uniqueness, suggesting that this aspect of the self-concept may be related to positive emotionality in general, rather than facilitated specifically by the experience of awe.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 960)  

...

##### Summary of the 4 studies presented in this paper

> Findings from Study 1 suggest that awe is elicited by informationrich stimuli, rather than the opportunity for material reward or social engagement. Study 3 suggested that awe-prone people are particularly comfortable with revising their mental representations of the world. Findings from Study 2 suggest that the experience of awe is associated with a sense of the smallness of the self and the presence of something greater than the self, as well as some disengagement from awareness of the self. Studies 3 and 4 suggested that awe does, however, have an impact on the content of the self-concept, increasing one’s sense of the self as part of a greater whole *a self-concept that de-emphasises the individual self.  

(Shiota et al., 2007, p. 960)  

...

##### Awe is a positive emotion that tends to direct away from the self

> present findings also suggest that, unlike other varieties of positive emotion, awe tends to direct attention away from the self and toward the environment.
