## Hedonic vs Eudaimonic Happiness

### The two main conceptualizations of happiness or wellbeing.

There are two main conceptualizations of happiness or wellbeing. That of hedonic and eudaimonic.

Hedonic is where happiness/wellbeing is something that is derived from affective and cognitive satisfaction and pleasure. *We do things that feel good in our lives and we feel satisfied about what we are doing in our lives.*

> ==From a hedonic perspective, well-being consists of the pleasantness of an individualâ€™s experiences and is achieved through the maximization of pleasure and the satisfaction of desires== (Kahneman,1999; Fredrickson, 2001). Subjective well-being, another term for happiness in the hedonic approach, consists of an affective component (i.e., the presence of positive emotional experiences and the absence of negative ones) and a cognitive component (i.e., the evaluation of oneâ€™s life as satisfyingâ€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 3)
 
Eudaimonic presents that wellbeing/happiness comes from the pursuit of meaningful goals that are in alignment with our deepest values, offering us a sense that we are realizing our "fullest potential". 

This means that happiness/wellbeing does not require positive feelings or feeling satisfied with what we are doing with our lives. We may, in fact, feel the opposite but as long as we are living in alignment with the various facets of eudaimonic wellbeingâ€”mastery, life purpose, autonomy, self-acceptance, positive relatedness, and personal growthâ€”then we will experience happiness. 

> In contrast, ==from a eudaimonic perspective==, well-being is more about following oneâ€™s deeply held values and realizing oneâ€™s fullest potential (Waterman, 1993; Ryff, 1995). As an example, ==psychological well-being is a construct that is thought to constitute eudaimonic well-being and consists of six facets of actualization including mastery, life purpose, autonomy, self-acceptance, positive relatedness, and personal growth==â€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 3)

#### Despite historical divide, these two perspectives on wellbeing work in tandem

Although there has a been a history of these two perspectives being at odds with each other, it has been shown that each can influence each other. Thus, it is likely that although they are distinct from each other, they are not mutually exclusive.

> Despite the contentious history between these two perspectives, hedonic and eudaimonic well-being indicators tend to be positively correlated and can influence one another implying that they are not mutually exclusive but overlapping and distinctâ€”(Capaldi et al., 2014, p. 3)
