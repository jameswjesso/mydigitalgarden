**Peter Gray:  The Characteristics of Play**


(1) selfdirected and selfchosen; 
(2) intrinsically motivated for play; 
(3) guided by flexible, creative mental rules; 
(4) imaginative—separated from realworld serious activity; 
(5) conducted in a nonstressed but active and alert frame of mind. 

The more of these characteristics an activity has, the more playlike it is."

**Andrew Huberman (Huberman Lab Podcast) Definition of play**

Play is the low stakes exploration of contingencies in a context of known variables, e.g. rules of play.  (in my own words)

**Play according to Polyvagal Theory**


> "Polyvagal Theory describes interactive play as a "neural exercise" that enhances the co-regulation of physiological state to promote the neural mechanisms involved in supporting mental and physical health. Interactive play as a neural exercise requires synchronous and reciprocal behaviours between individuals and necessitates an awareness of each other's social engagement system. Access to the social engagement system insures that the sympathetic activation of involved in the mobilization does not hijack the nervous system, resulting in playful movements transitioning into aggressive behavior.
