## Notes


##### Pyridoxal-5â€²-phosphate (PLP or P-5-P) is a co-enzyme metabolite of b6.

It is the only metabolite that is known to be active.

The assumption is that because of this, all b6 effects might come from p5p. Although, that is not for certain nor confirmed.

> That said,Â **only pyridoxal phosphate is an active coenzyme**

#### Good levels of B6 are important for healthy production of various neuromodulators  

For example, melatonin.

> P5P is needed for the production ofÂ [melatonin](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/melatonin/), also known asÂ _the sleep hormone_. Research hasnâ€™t found a direct link between P-5-P levels andÂ [insomnia](https://selfhacked.com/blog/methods-to-fall-asleep-insomniac/), but taking vitamin B6 before bed increased melatonin release from the pineal gland in a study of 120 children

This good level of b6/p5p can be helpful in sleep (theoretically)

Other neuomodulators that are produced by enzymes that require b6 include dopamine, norepinephrine, gaba, acetylcholine, and serotonin.

It is unknown though, whether supplemntaion helps with production of those chemcials.

##### Prolactin reduced by via increased in dopamine p5p-b6

Increases in dopamine lower prolactin. The metabolism of b6 into p5p increased dopamine. There is no solid evidence that p5p direclty lowers prolactin, although som. there is also anecdotyle eveidence that supplemntion of it can help prevent gynecomastia (abnomral breast growth in men) when taken dring or after steroid cycles (according to body bulding forums).

##### Potential Benefits from b6

Benefits ultimately seem to be a matter of preventing the damaging effects of b6 depletion. (usually nerve conditions, such as seizers)

##### potential benefits of p5p over b6

- No need for it to be converted means greater bioavailability
- might be helpful in conditions where the body lacks the enzyme needed to convert PLP (an aspect of b6) to p5p.

##### Side effect and toxicity of b6

High doses of b6 can cause nerve damamge, movement disorders, and skin lesions. Additionally, a rebound effect of too much b6 might cause the redction of the enzymes needed for its converstion into p5p, causing issues with defincinecy down the line.

Also, although p5p can avoid the conversion enzymes needed, there is the possibility of direct issues with digestions (vommiting, diarrhea, cramps), the long term effects of p5p usage have not be clarified.

b6 can impact the pitiutary glad in ways that reduce prolactin, growth hormone, and ACTCH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone, which is responsible for the production of cortisol, which is an important hormone in the body). This can be a problem is it is excessive to the context of oneâ€™s body.

#### Dosage of b6

clinical data suggest that doses of approx 250mg/day for 30 days was safe, but efficacy was limited.. No increased benefit was found at 750mg.

> **Takeaway**
> 
> Pyridoxal phosphate (P-5-P or PLP) is an active form of vitamin B6, a nutrient that supports the immune system, heart and brain health, blood sugar control, and more. P-5-P drives the activity of over 100 enzymes and helps make key neurotransmitters in the brain.
> 
> Vitamin B6 supplements may help with nausea during pregnancy, sideroblastic anemia, atherosclerosis, vitamin B6-dependent seizures, and premenstrual syndrome.
> 
> Taking P-5-P delivers the active B6 form to your body. People with liver disease and rare genetic disorders canâ€™t convert vitamin B6 into the active form and may thus need P-5-P supplements. The therapeutic potential of P-5-P in the general population is not well researched.
> 
> P-5-P side effects are mild and typically include digestive issues. Pregnant women should avoid it just in case, while others should consult with their doctor before supplementing.
