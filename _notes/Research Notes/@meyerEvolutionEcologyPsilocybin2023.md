>[!Abstract]
> Fungi produce diverse metabolites that can have antimicrobial, antifungal, antifeedant, or psychoactive properties. Among these metabolites are the tryptamine-derived compounds psilocybin, its precursors, and natural derivatives (collectively referred to as psiloids), which have played significant roles in human society and culture. The high allocation of nitrogen to psiloids in mushrooms, along with evidence of convergent evolution and horizontal transfer of psilocybin genes, suggest they provide a selective benefit to some fungi. However, no precise ecological roles of psilocybin have been experimentally determined. The structural and functional similarities of psiloids to serotonin, an essential neurotransmitter in animals, suggest that they may enhance the fitness of fungi through interference with serotonergic processes. However, other ecological mechanisms of psiloids have been proposed. Here, we review the literature pertinent to psilocybin ecology and propose potential adaptive advantages psiloids may confer to fungi.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This paper explored the various evolutionary/ecological roles that psilocybin (and other psiloids) play in the mushrooms themselves and in their environment. It explores several different theories, concluding that there is presently no "precise" ecological role for psilocybin yet determined. Although, it seems very likely that animals (esp insects) were/are the main target for psiloids, and that the presence or absence of psiloids across fungi genera seem to be determined by coevolution with different animals.

## Notes

#### Psiloids

Psiloids are a term to describe the several different alkaloids produced through the psilocybin biosynthetic gene cluster, by fungi that are similar to psilocybin and psilocin. These include 

- Norbaeocystin (4-OP-T)  
- 4-hydroxytryptamine (4-HT) 
- baeocystin (4-OPNMT)  
- norpsilocin (4-OH-NMT)
- psilocybin (4-OP-DMT)  
- psilocin (4-OH-DMT) 
- aeruginascin (4-OP-TMT) 
- 4-trimethylhydroxytryptamine (4-OH-TMT)

#### The ecological role of psilocybin will have had nothing to do with humans, as it was around for millions of years

The ecological role of psilocybin will have had nothing to do with humans in particular, as its evolution likely came about millions of years before humans came on the scene.

> Although most attention to psilocybin derives from its spiritual cultural history and potential therapeutic properties, its ecological functions likely preceded human use by tens of millions of years (Reynolds et al., 2018; Rodríguez Arce and Winkelman, 2021). Consequently, psilocybin’s evolutionary history and ecological interactions probably do not entail a long-term role for our species.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 2)

#### Some general facts about psilocybin mushrooms


Most psilocybin mushroom species are dung or wood loving saprotrophs, apart from the cicada fungus

> most known psilocybin producers are mushroom-forming fungi that inhabit dung and late-wood decay niches (Reynolds et al., 2018), some species are ectomycorrhizal (Matheny et al., 2019), and there is one report of psilocybin in an insect pathogen (Boyce et al., 2019). There is also an unconfirmed account of psilocybin in a lichen—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 2)

They are found on every continent except for Antarctica.

> Psilocybin producing fungi are documented on all continents except Antarctica and are found in diverse climates, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, with the highest species concentrations and diversity found in the neotropic—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 2)

  
#### The psiloid aeruginascin, present in mycorrhizal fungi, may play a role in fungi-plant-communication

There is a proposition here that aeruginascin may play a role in fungi-to-plant communications in ectomycorrhizal species (which is a variety of mycorrhizal fungi that do not penetrate individual cells of the organism is living off of) 

> The presence of aeruginascin (and psiloids in general) in an ectomycorrhizal species raises the idea that it may play a role in plantfungal communication, given the structural similarity with auxin plant hormones. Auxins produced by other mycorrhizal fungi are known to facilitate interactions with their hosts—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 4)

#### The Derrumbes mushrooms of Mexico grow in the cracks left over from landslides

*Derrumbes* mushrooms of Mexico include several varieties and are called such because they grow in the scars left over from landslides.

> Multiple species of Psilocybe found in the wet montane forests of central Mexico (e.g., Ps. zapotecorum, Ps. hoogshagenii, Ps. caerulescens, Ps. barrerae, Ps. muliercula) are commonly referred to as “derrumbes” (landslides) mushrooms by indigenous peoples. These mushrooms typically emerge from vertical walls and scars created by landslides at high elevations (Guzm ́ an, 2012), where accumulated buried organic material provides a carbon source.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 4)

  
....  

#### The biosynthetic gene cluster for psilocybin has spread through horizontal gene transfer, which is significant 

The psilocybin gene cluster has be shared between species through horizontal gene transfer. This is significant because this is not a common or easy feat, and horizontal gene transfer amongst mushrooms is rare itself.

> The psilocybin gene cluster is inferred to have undergone multiple horizontal transfers (Fig. 2A) across divergent genera (Awan et al., 2018; Reynolds et al., 2018). This is noteworthy due to the various obstacles preventing such transfers in eukaryotes, such as genetic material traversing the boundaries of the cell wall and nuclear envelope (Jaramillo et al., 2015; Jensen, 2016). Given the odds against the retention of randomly acquired DNA, a selective benefit of producing psilocybin in the recipient fungi can easily be inferred—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 4)

  
....  

#### Psilocybin's ecological role, evolutionarily, has something to do with decay niches

Given the history of psilocybin evolution, whatever it is that psilocybin is for, ecologically, it would seem that its relevance is significant in "decay niches".

> Most other known psilocybin producers are saprobes and likely acquired the wood-decay-associated cluster through HGT (Fig. 2A) (Reynolds et al., 2018). This suggests that psilocybin may have different functions in different ecological niches but is most useful in decay niches.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 5)
  
....  

#### Psiloids are very similar to serotonin

Psiloids are very similar to serotonin, which is a very important molecules across "the tree of life".

> Psiloids structurally resemble serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT; Fig. 1B), an important molecule across the tree of life involved in intercellular signaling, growth, development, and responses to external stimuli (Erland et al., 2019; Roshchina, 2016)—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 6)

  
....  
#### The function and role of serotonin in animals

> In animals, serotonin serves as a classical neurotransmitter (fast-acting; involved in memory, learning, and coordination), a neuromodulator (slow-acting; involved in arousal, hormone release), or a neurohormone (slow-acting; involved in metabolism, growth, development, reproduction), and it is involved in multiple physiological and behavioral processes.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 6)

  
....  

#### Psiloids have different behavioural effects on different creatures.  

They have different behaviour effect on different creatues.  
  
Thus it coule be playing a very diverse role in mudluating fuana beahviour wihtin a forest ecosystem.  
Consdier this in the context of it also plauying a role in the communication between fungi and plants as mentioned earlier.  
  
Given that it also bind to dopamine receptors, which are also present in a wide range of animals, the complexity of their impact in a forest ecology is potentially substantial.

> Given the diverse roles of receptor subtypes in animals (Bubak et al., 2020; Sharp and Barnes, 2020; Tierney, 2018), psiloids likely have a broad range of effects across and within different animal phyla.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 7)

  
....  

#### Psilocyin also binds to dopamine d1 and d2 receptors

Although psilocin's action on the ht2a receptor is the primary mudulator of their psychedelic effect, it also has an even stronger bdingin affinity to d1 and d3 dopamine receptors.  


> psilocin has a much stronger binding affinity to dopamine receptors D1 and D3 than to 5-HT2A. In fact, its affinity to D1 is significantly higher than that of serotonin or even dopamine itself, and it is comparable to dopamine’s binding affinity to D3—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 7)

....  

> the diversity of potential targets in animal signaling pathways draws attention to the lack of conclusive evidence that 5-HT2A is the primary receptor of ecological significance, despite its importance in human phenomenology.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 7)

  
....  

#### Reasons to propose that psilocybin may have evolved to target animals 

**Blood Brain Barrier**

Given the unique chemical structure of psilocybin meaning that is so easily crosses the blood brain barrier of animals, there is possibility that it evolved to target animals.

> The 4-substituted nature of psiloids offers further clues that they may be targeted to animal central nervous systems.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 7)

**b-Carbolines and the entourage effects**

This is further bolstered when considering the entourage effect of how the other tryptamines present in various psilocybin species potentiate each other, as well as the presence of b-carbolines that further modulate the psiloids' psychoactive effects. 

> wholemushroom extracts have been shown to produce more potent physiological effects on mammals than pure synthetic psilocybin, even at onetenth of the concentration (Zhuk et al., 2015). This is consistent with the “entourage effect” hypothesis, which posits that psiloids and/or other fungal compounds act synergistically in animals—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 8)

....  

  
**Repellant**

There is quality evidence for insect repellant effects of psilocybin as one of the reasons it evolved, although this is not the only explaination as it also seems to work to benefit from consumption by some animals (and there are many examples of these mushrooms being consumed by insects)

For exmaple, as a selective deterants to ensure the mushroom is not consumed prior to the mushroom reaching spore-producing maturity, although this suggestion is flawed, though, do to the fact that psilocybin is present at all stages of the mushroom and even in the mycelium, which suggests that it plays a role other than as a repellant.

> Anecdotal reports of animals consuming psilocybin-producing mushrooms primarily describe partial (rather than whole) mushroom consumption, which is possibly explained by some level of deterrence or behavior modification. The lamellae of poisonous mushrooms frequently have lower toxin concentrations than other mushroom tissues, which may guide fungivorous animals to the spore-bearing gills (Eilers and Nelson, 1974). Indeed, the spores of psilocybin-producing mushrooms lack psilocybin (Gotvaldov ́ a et al., 2021), making it likely that the spore-producing gills would also have considerably lower psilocybin concentrations than the surrounding tissues.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 6)

...

> While the psilocybin gene cluster is also expressed most highly in the early stages of mushroom development, the concentration of psilocybin appears to remain constant from the early stages of development to maturity (Demmler et al., 2020), suggesting that any potential repellent effect would not be limited to the early stages of development. Furthermore, the presence of psilocybin in vegetative mycelium, although in lower concentrations than the basidiocarps (Blei et al., 2020), also suggests it has some utility beyond the defense of its reproductive structures.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 6)


**Spore spreading**

One such purpose may have been for spore spreading through the animals consuming the fungi getting so high that they were better picked off my predators, who then shat the spores out further across the forest

> Fungal tissues (e.g., mycelium, mushrooms, spores) are viable not only after passage through slug stomachs but also through the digestive tracts of toads that have consumed slugs containing fungal tissues—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 11)

...
#### CoEvolution and the presence of psilocybin/psiloids or other psychoactives is determined by the specific animals that fungi is targeting 

There are several different genera of fungi that have differing presentations of psilocybin. Some that have it and some that have other compounds we know to be psychoactive to animals. The suggestion here is that the presence of psilocybin/psiloids or other psychoactives is determined by the specific animals that fungi is targeting, suggesting that the presence of psilocybin in various mushrooms is something that emerged through coevolution with animals.


> Diversification of other neuroactive compounds alongside psilocybin suggests coevolution with animals—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 8)
...
> The possibility that psilocybin and other neuroactive compounds are interchangeable could suggest that they serve similar ecological functions but may be adapted to different predators or predator populations with more recently evolved toxin resistance.—(Meyer and Slot, 2023, p. 8)
