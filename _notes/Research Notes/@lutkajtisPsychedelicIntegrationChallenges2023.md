## Notes


##### If process does not resolve during the session, it will continue afterwards

[[If process does not resolve during the psychedelic session, it will continue afterwards|noted here]]

> In the current study, six participants mentioned changes to mood, energy and cognition that occurred after the psilocybin experience. Sometimes mood fluctuations occurred immediately following the psilocybin session, as in the case of Kylie (f; 50s), whose psilocybin experience mainly involved feelings of overwhelming sadness and cathartic crying.

...

##### post- ecstatic blues

After encountering the divine, and the beauty of ecstatic experiences, some people have a rebound of low mood, even "desolation". The term is post-ecstatic blues.

> The literature on ecstatic experiences describes expressions of ecstatic highs followed by periods of low mood and desolation, or what mystics term ‘dryness’ or ‘divine homesickness’

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 215)

...
##### Feeling disconnected after psilocybin

Disconnection from community...  
  
Behavioural/emotional presentation... signal towards self or others... resolves but maybe not ....getting support  
  
People dont necessarily understand, despite how much they might actually want to or care about you. Tarnished by even well meaning hands  
  
Do not cast you pearls upon swine  
  
Spaciousness

> Feeling disconnected from community after an ecstatic experience is a relatively common phenomenon. Such reports can be traced back thousands of years to Plato (c. 428-7 BCE - 348-7 BCE), who wrote of the illuminated mystic struggling to re-integrate into society and being mocked for their unworldliness (Plato & Bloom, 1968). Psychiatrist and transpersonal pioneer Roberto Assagioli (1888–1974) also noted that an individual may appear unworldly and even less functionally effective in the days and weeks following an ecstatic experience, and could attract criticism from their community as a result

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 216)

...

##### Disconnection due to a sense of superiority after psilocybin

The disconnection feeling can be an expression of superiority too. In this case, comments and crictism might be valid signals

> Additionally, individuals who have experienced an altered state of consciousness may view themselves as different, special or even superior to others who have not had a similar experience

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 216)

...

##### Do not cast your pearls upon swine

> She also noted the significance of having a supportive community, saying: “it’s really important to be able to talk about these experiences with people who can relate, and not people who are going to look at you skeptically and make you question your own experience.”

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 216)

...

##### re-experiencing post-psychedelic, in process v processing

When continuing to be in process/processing... we can have somatic issues as well, such as reliving old painful or demanding physical traumas as though re-experiencing them. Perhaps even just spontaneous tremors. --  
  
In the case of the tremors, one might find some value in seeking guidance in doing what is called Tremor Release Exercises, or TRE. There are free videos online that explain the process, but it is always beneficial to get guidance from a trained professional whenever entering a new movement of therapeutic practice  
  
This, too, is a part of the ongoing process/processing... however, if this gets to a point of being frigtehing, debilitating, or just gnerally concerning, it might be time to seek profession integraiton support  
  
Energetic sensation.s in the body... practices like thai chi, chi gong, or yoga may help in this respect

> Re-experiencing symptoms

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 217)

...

##### Proper integration is generally needed to maintain positive benefits of psychedelic experience

Without proper integration, which includes good support in that process be it amongst friends or with a professional, there is no guarantee that the positive effects will endure.

> Sofie also mentioned that she should have worked with a therapist or “integration specialist” after the retreat, as she got “sucked back into the cycle of reality” and she believes this is why some of her positive after-effects were not enduring. Similarly, Zoe (f; 20s) commented that she did not integrate the experience properly and that she could possibly have gained more positive and lasting after-effects if she did, noting: “I did my work before [preparation]; I didn’tdomy work after - that was the biggest mistake”.

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 218)

...

##### Immediately following the journey is the ideal time to be doing integration. 

Immediately following the journey is the ideal time to be doing integration. This is thee window of opportunity

> that the immediate post-experience and post-retreat period may be a critical time when additional support, care and monitoring is vital.

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 218)

...

##### Even when everything is set up to go well, integration can still be challenging.

> Hence, this suggests that even in situations where the psychedelic experience is considered to be beneficial and the set and setting is optimally controlled for, integration challenges can still occur.

(Lutkajtis and Evans, 2023, p. 218)

...

###### Inform community as part of preparation

It is important to inform you close peoples that you are going to journey beforehand, as this will help to prepare your community to see you and support you as needed. Which will help lessen the chances of a sense of disconnection afterwards.

> Regarding feelings of disconnection from community, it could be recommended that people brief their loved ones before a psychedelic experience and organize to have a network of support in the days and weeks following the event.
