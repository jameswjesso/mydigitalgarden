The comedown of MDMA reported amongst recreational users (blue Tuesday) is not a consequence of MDMA's effect on the brain, but a variety of compounding effects emerging from a recreational context of use. e.g. impure supply, sleeplessness, dehydration, poly substance use, malnutrition, heat, etc

There is little to no comedown when used in therapeutic contexts, but in fact generally the opposite, and afterglow that lasts about a week.

> The results support the overall safety and tolerability of clinically administered MDMA and, importantly, suggest that the ‘come downs’ previously associated with the substance may be explained by confounds in research relating to the illicit sourcing of the drug and specific environmental setting for recreational consumption.” ([Sessa et al., 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/P4BUYR8I)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BF45C6BN?page=1&annotation=YCAP4U2H))


MDMA does not lead to dopaminergic cell death, and may not be neurotoxic at all when used in therapeutic-context doses

> “Among the MDMA scientific community, worry about dopaminergic cell death abated, but study into the drug’s effects on serotonin toxicity continued. However, in many studies that suggested neurotoxicity, dosages and patterns of administration were not analogous with human consumption, particularly when MDMA is orally administered in a therapeutic context (Baumann et al., 2007; De La Garza et al., 2007; Sessa and Nutt, 2007).” ([Sessa et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/P4BUYR8I)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BF45C6BN?page=2&annotation=PU52AD5I))
