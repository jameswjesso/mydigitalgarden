*Polysemic is where experience of self is not differentiated from other and the cognitive/rational mind was not dominant form of perception but a part of a more horizonatlly diversified multisensory basis for percepting, understanding, and navigating reality. Being in a flow state is being in a polysemic state

 Univocity thinking—rational/linear/cause and effect —is about differentiation, categorization, dissection, and creating hiearchy.

The long history of Western thought is also a history of unvocity Dominating and supressing polsemic thinking, starting with the Sumerian civiliation.*

**Reference quote:**  

> "Prior to the Sumer civilization and subsequent civilizations, human societies shifted between polysemy, a multisensory participation in a living, permeable world, and univocity, linear logical thought used to solve a specific problem with conscious cause and effect analysis. 
> 
> Polysemic mentalization does not make differentiations between self and others, including particular animals, plants, or natural entities (e.g., rivers), whereas univocity is all about differentiation, categorizing, and creating hierarchies. 
> 
> Western history, as Bram tells it, is a story about the suppression of polysemy and dominance of univocity, which parallels the suppression of the feminine principle of cycling through birth, life," ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=82))
