##### There are small amounts of beta-carbolines in several species of psilocybin mushrooms

There are very small amounts of b-carbolines present in several specifies of psilocybin mushrooms

> Trace amounts of β-carbolines with known monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties were also recently identified in several Psilocybe species.12

##### The psychoactivity of baeocystin and norpsilocin

Through measuring the head-twitch response, baeocystin was found to produce no psychedelic effect ("indistinguishable from saline").

> baeocystin was indistinguishable from saline, indicating that baeocystin alone would likely not induce 5-HT2A receptor mediated psychoactive effects in vivo.  

(Sherwood et al., 2020, p. 3)  

...

norpsilocin was even more active at binding to the 5ht2a sites than psilocin, however more easily degraded by MAO. Thus it is likely that norpsilocin (and baeocystin) hare broken down in the gut before they can have any activity in the brain.

> Given that secondary amines tend to be degraded more readily by MAO enzymes compared to tertiary amines,37 these data would support the hypothesis that baeocystin and norpsilocin may be rendered inactive by metabolism before reaching targets in the central nervous system.

> that baeocystin’s lack of CNS activity is possibly related to pharmacokinetics but not lack of activity at 5-HT2A receptors.  

(Sherwood et al., 2020, p. 4)  

...

Baeocystin, although rapidly regraded by MAO, might actually be supporintg levels of psilocin by taking the MAO attention, taking one for the team.  
  
***This also suggests that it might be possible to induce a state where baeocysin is active through the blocking of MAO*** <-- entourage effect!

> Though unexplored in this report, baeocystin could potentially exert a synergistic effect with psilocin/psilocybin by competing for MAO, effectively increasing psilocin concentration in the blood. Additionally, if rapid degradation by MAO is not the predominate route of inactivation, the interaction of baeocystin/norpsilocin with peripheral serotonin receptors may be possible.
