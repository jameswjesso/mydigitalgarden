## Personal Summary

>[!...]
>This is the transcripts of a series of conversations/interview with Jenkinson, conducted by Kimberly Anne Johnson. The book reads easy, and explores a lot of concepts. Although the vast majority of them are contained in other books of his, and are (IMO) better articulated in those books than in this one. 
>
>This is fair, given that he is offering them as answers on the fly in an interview, but it wasn't the most impactful read for me of his work. It did serve as a nice process of reminder for those things, with some new perspective in the mix, and I would recommend it to some people, but I may also caution them if it was their first foray into his work. 
>
>I enjoyed reading it, although I am highly unlikely to read this one again in the same way I feel myself called to reading his other books more than once.

## Notes

#### Wisdom requires effort (vs. Prejudice)

Prejudice comes easy to us. We are born into this world with a propensity to it, and have it passed down and reinforced throughout our lives. Wisdom, however, requires substantial effort to not only cultivate but sustain. 

> “The world in its conditions is so encouraging of your prejudices that you could almost be forgiven for being unconscious about them. Wisdom on the other hand, takes a tremendous amount of labor, almost on a daily basis, to maintain and sustain it, to keep it in view into translate, it constantly into what might direct action activism could be.”
> 
> “Wisdom […] takes a tremendous amount of labour, almost on a daily basis, to maintain and sustain it, to keep it in view and to translate it constantly into […] action”. - pg. 15

…

#### The Meaning Of Fate

Coming from a Latin verb that Jenkinson presents means “to put into motion by speaking”, he presents fate as meaning something like “that which has been put into motion by the Gods”, coupled with a secondary inquiry that calls us to consider how we then respond to the situation of fate. 

> Etymologically the word fate comes from the Latin word for the verb _to make_ or _to do_, typically _by speaking_. So, literally, fate was what the Gods said, what they put into motion by speaking. And what the Gods said, is what we mean by _gravity_ and _physics_, and _chemistry_ and _astronomy_, and a number of the givens that constitute the physical world, the natural world, the world that we're on the receiving end of. The world is what the Gods have said. It forecloses is not at all upon the second half, the nuances second half, which goes like this: now that the gods have spoken, _what shall you do?_ - pg 20

…

#### Entrust Others with The Meaning (and Legacy) of Our Life

This seems to be in response to the modern phenomenon of having one's wake while still alive, and him presenting that not only that make it not you wake, but it is an expression of you attempting to control how those who you will go before will remember your life, which is an expression of saying that you don't trust them to hold your memory without you there to dictate how. 

This is in contrast to peoples who still have "village-mindedness" that trust their relations to hold their life's meaning in good order and care, and that is not only their job to do so (not yours) but that they are the only one's that can do so because that meaning is not yours to create as it only comes into views after you've left.


> The real stuff happens […] when you're utterly and completely gone from among us. That's when we start talking about you in a completely different way. And that's when the meaning of your life begins to be assembled. It [dying] has to be done first. So, it's not yours to assemble. If you were there, you're a fascist, and you’re refusing to entrust the meaning of your life to others, which is what a community-minded village-minded person is not only capable of, but actually owes his or her neighbours and fellows, and so on. Here's the thing: release your death grip on the meaning of your life long enough to include the other people who not very secretly are the principal architects of the meaning of your days. And the meaning is a consequence of your, what do they call that… legacy. And your legacy you don't get to know. It's not supposed to be yours. It's a consequence of your death, you know. -pg. 25


…

#### Not “my” death -- Dying as a last act of citizenship


This is the conclusion of a story of a woman who was trying to get her father to talk about his dying, to have a "die wise death", and he outright refused.

Jenkinson emphatically presents that the belief that one's death is their own and everyone else should respect the dying person's wishes to engage it however that person chooses is bullshit. He states that given that the consequences of one's dying is on those they leave behind, that dying process is not a final self-made, lifestyle design opportunity but a responsibility, and obligation, one has to those they leave behind, an obligation to consider how it will affect their living in the world and their own dying and to conduct yourself accordingly. 

I have heard him say elsewhere something to the effect of *how you die is like how you set the table for your family to eat at after you're gone.* 

Also, this feels like it connects with the later note on being [[@jenkinsonReckoning2022#Being on the learning end of dying|being on the learning end of dying]] and that death is asking something of us, and showing up to what is being asked of us is part of fulfilling that obligation. 
 
> And here's why: the consequence of the way he's dying: will any of them accrue to him? Will he have to live out one consequence that he put into motion by his bizarre and self-absorbed silence? And the answer is: _not one_. Not that we know of. Who will have to leave them out? She will. And then her kids, if she had any, and on it goes, you see. The ripples are not centred around the people who’re dying. They emanate from them. **Your act of dying is your last act of citizenship.** [emphasis mine] It is your last act of parenting, if that's what you are. And he has an obligation to father this woman, _then_, at that time. And you don't father somebody by refusing to engage them at the level of talking about what's becoming of you and your fears about it. That's _his_ problem. Her problem is that she thinks that the only way that she can put it off is that she bows to his ratchet example, and somehow insinuates my stuff, the Die Wise stuff, into the mix, which is inconceivable. It's not going to happen. -- pg 27

>[!tip] There is a lot here
>(This quote feels like a gateway to explore so much of his perspectives on dying in what he calls a deathphobic culture. I need to acitvely stop ecploring my thoguhts to move on)

…

#### Culture work, not personal work

I appreciate his sense that trying to help the individual attain some degree of stability in their life cannot, truly, manage to effect substantial and prevailing changes on the culture that destabilized the individual. 

Further, too, that an individual cannot truly find the sense of stability within themselves that they seek is they are doing so exclusively through the lens of the "personal" only, and must include efforting to be in the culture and working with that as a part of their "work".

(Although, personally I also recognize there is still value in therapy for the individual, too, as this can help prevent a person from projecting the baggage of their personal stuff onto the civic stuff, conflating the two and expecting society to change to fix their personal wounds.)

With respect to leaving counselling and going into teaching...

> If I have a thing called a life's work, it's been an attempt to translate **a sense of citizenship responsibility, and direct action, by articulating the notion of culture work instead of personal work.** [emphasis mine] Doesn't pay nearly as well. Personal work will net out handsomely. Cultural work, though, there are no customers for culture-work. There's barely a marketplace for cultural work. And yet that's where virtually all of this stuff is happening. That's where it's most amenable to consequence: at the level of culture. And this is where your opportunities for a genuine kind of sanity are to be found: not a removal from the cultural that the troubles you so, but from your sense of agency and participation in it. -- pg 35

…

#### Heartbrokenness is a responsibility -- less heart as a solution to its brokenness

Grief as brokenheartedness, and as that which positions us to live in the world where heart-full presence to the world is possible. That it is the pain of heartbrokenness that allows the world to touch us, and thus allows us to move through the world touching and being touched by it, which is necessary to live a meaningful as well as to fulfill your role in your generation's spirit work. 

It's a condition we are born with, and cannot get rid of, we can only attempt to cover it up and in doing so we end up not with less heartbrokenness, but less heart. As a consequence, we can no longer really touch/be touched by the world.

> … being brokenhearted in a culture that doesn't believe in broken heartedness, that believes in wholeness only. The solution a culture like that generates for broken heartedness is ‘less heart, therefore less brokenness’. […] Heartbreak is not a decision. Heartbreak is not a position. It's not an orthodoxy, it's not a dogma. Heartbreak is a responsibility. That's explicitly what the word means. And you don't decide to be heartbroken, right? The heartbrokenness this happens before your prejudices arise. And after they exhaust themselves, that heartbreak is there. -- pg 62

…

#### The piranha-like nature of avoiding context in order to justify attacking a piece

This hit home for me as I have seen this kind of fallacy attacks ("cancelling") become so intense over the years and it—as a part of/contributor to the growing collapse of social institutions like journalism and democracy—scares me.

The inability/unwillingness to consider context and give people the benefit of the doubt first is not only scary because of its potential impact on individuals (including the possibly that I may find myself in the target sites of this kind of attack) but also on our ability as a society to cohere enough to accomplish anything of lasting merit; especially given the times of crisis we are in now and the impact our choices are going to have on the generations (human and non human) to follow us. 

> There's gracelessness and almost piranha-like nature in a public that's ready to jump at any time on one piece of something that’s said, without zooming out at all, or having a proactive approach to seeking, to finding a full view of what you might care about or be wanting to find. -- pg 63 [Johnson]

…

#### The goal of a feeling is to extinguish itself, but can get stuck on their way and become identity

He presents feelings as having a kind of agency (very [[IFS]]) and that they want to, are meant to be felt until they are gone. When they are not able to do so, when they get stuck in us, they have the possibility to becomes integrated into the architecture (his premise). But that is not where they want to be or how they are supposed to exists within us, and the consequences aren't good. 

> that they properly turn into the compost that they're trying to get to. I mean, our feelings get stuck in us on their way to their fate. I put it this way, because I'm speaking as an animist now, obviously, and attributing a certain kind of purposefulness to feelings. They're trying it seems to me to play out and in so doing to extinguish, and they get waylaid on the way through us from their proper purpose, they get stuck, and they stay, they turn into identities and things like this. It's a deeply, spectacularly, well, considered orientation, we have, that we cling to our feelings, mistaking them for the … You know, the most adamant part of us is not necessarily the truest.
> 
> […] To use a technical philosophical term, the feelings are _reified_. They can turn into a thing. Instead of being on their way to something, they turn into something. The problem with reification is it doesn't give way readily, and once you've turned feelings into something… Man, there's a reason that the word identity has such a fixity about it. Even though even the notion of fluid identity still relies on the substrate called identity. -- pg 91

…

#### Human freedom is a fact -- you can choose differently in recurring circumstances

Human freedom is not a feeling we have when certain conditions are met, but the expression of a capacity we all have: to act differently in contexts that are otherwise identical to contexts where we generally behave in patterned ways. 

Also, that this is a very romantic proposition for what freedom entails, but it is something vital.

(This feels like it connects to his distaste over people claiming rights without accepting any of the responsibility that comes with those rights.)

> A conscience is there to provide you with the possibility of behaving differently in a circumstance that's virtually identical to the previous one. That, it seems to me, it's what human freedom is. It's not a freedom from recurring circumstance. Human freedom works like this: you’re face with a circumstance that is so familiar that it includes all kinds of familiar reactivity in you. And for all of that, by virtue of the time in that you've lent to it or whatever it is, or luck, you respond otherwise, for the first time. It doesn't sound very gallant. It doesn't sound very noble. It doesn't sound like there's a lot to be had from it. But there's an awful lot riding on it. Understand human freedom as a fact, not a feeling. An action. The fact is that you can respond differently when nothing else is different. Sometimes you must. -- pg 100

…

#### The mark of Friendship, and why reciprocity is not necessarily balance.

I heard this from him a while back and really appreciated it: true friendship is being willing to risk the friendship on behalf of the friend.  

He flushes this out here, and outlines how friendships are not about balance as much as reciprocity, showing up for each other and letting each other show up. This is rarely a matter of balanced equality, because there are times where the costs born to show up to each other are disproportionate, and that's a part of the deal of true friendship.


> What's the mark of friendship? I understand friendship to be perhaps the sovereign of all our accomplishments, interpersonally. Why is that? Because there's something in the nature of friendship that the friend will risk the friendship itself, for the friend’s sake. When crunch time comes, as it often does in friendships, you may lose the friendship because you’ve acted for the sake of a friend. In other words, the reciprocity breaks down, because one person doesn't feel supported, because the other person has acted in the name of friendship. Now, it takes a lot of examination on the part of the actor to be certain that that's where the motivation is coming from, and the rest. But this is why it's a high wire act. Friendship really is a challenge, because it assumes and requires an ongoing reciprocity. But it's not the same as feeling that it's balance, because at any given time, real friendships, tilt and twist in various directions, that would seem to benefit one or the other, it would seem to affirm one, and not the other, this kind of thing. It's a costly affair, and it's not democratically distributed, in the sense of the friendship is ‘working out’ for all concerned all the time. -- pg 126

…

#### Being on the learning end of dying

with respect to the fact of dying and the choice to die (as a verb, an act prior to the momentum of biological death) and the desperation that, in the modern Western world, often leads us to attempt to exert control over the thing even when its obvious that it has long taken the lead.

> So dying is, should be allowed to be, its own, standalone, unparalleled event, which you as a dying person – and your family, too – are on the learning end of, not the controlling end of. -- pg. 128

…

#### Boat Prayer - Its all so much bigger than you

This really hits home for me as it touches on the essence of what my own prayers look like when I can called by circumstance to prayer (an action perhaps more rare than would best serve me).

>  the whole thing is bigger than you. I mean, _what a relief_. Jesus, what a relief. I don't know if I said this last time, but it bears, repeating, if I did.
>  
>  There's that old Provençal prayer, which, because of its brevity, I'm able to remember. It simply says this: _God help me. My boat is so small. Your sea, so immense._ Is it? Just about covers anything you can think of. God, help me. My boat is so small, your sea, so immense. -- pg. 141

#### Love like THAT, in the endings and as endings

Fuck me if this isn’t one of the hardest things Jenkinson has ever asked me to hold.
Thinking of this in respect to Alysha (either her dying or her grappling with mine) is heart wrenching.

> The ending of things is trying to oblige you to reallocate your love to someplace where it's no longer relied upon as a binding agent, an insurance policy against loneliness or reversal of Fortune. That doesn't mean the collapse of distance. It means that even your understanding of love submits to the ending of things. So somewhere in there, you begin to love the ending of what you love.
> 
> Failure to do so as to enter into a kind of horrific ‘I love the person, but…’ it's like the Puritan ‘I love you, but I hate your sin’, that kind of stuff. So, you know, ‘I love the fact that you're here, but I hate the fact that you're dying on me.’
> 
> We have no obligation to hate the fact that we're dying, there's a person we love is dying on us. What you have available to you instead is that you can love the fact that they are still there. _But you're finding it immensely challenging, because they're still there._
> 
> So how do you live something, love something, that is not going to last? _Honey, you've been doing it your whole life._ Everything you love isn't going to last, is in the act of not lasting. Even your love is not going to last, even your love not lasting is not going to last.
> 
> So, love like that. - pg 145

…

### Chapter 3 - Giving In to Frailty

#### The difference between what Hope and Grief require and ask of us

Hope is something that sells out today on the bet for a better future.
Greif submits to what is, entirely, now, because that's just how it is. 

> It will just suffice to say, that hopes principal M.O. is that it needs a future. That's where it works, OK? And relies entirely on the oncomingness of the future, a sense of promise, a possibility that all is not foreclosed upon. These are the building blocks of hope now. So would that you're willing to proceed as a kind of an inadvertant existentialist, and devote yourself so thoroughly to the present day that you can't, or won't rely upon the oncomingness of the future, so that you will feel it to be something bordering on dereliction of duty or truancy, or something closer to bad faith even. […]
> 
> What does grief do that hope can't dream of? Grief, it seems to me, is not trying to get to the other side of anything so that something can be different. Grief, first and foremost, is an irretrievable willingness to submit to the natural order of things. It's an act of submission, grief is. It's not an active biding your time until this too passes and then you get another cleaner shot at the matter. You have no obligation in a grief-informed understanding to hold your nose. Grief is the full respiration. I can't overstate the mandate that grief makes available to us, and trusts us with and asks of us as well -- pg. 171

>[!tip] HWA!
>(This has me thinking of [[HWA - Here We Are]] but with much more gravity)

…

#### A Rilke Poem about God

Jenkinson speaks to the value of the I don't know part, and that is is often missed in favor of the other 3.
That the *I don't know* is an expression of being in relationship with the Mystery, but most people tend to default to wanting to be a thing of majesty rather than be a thing in dumbfounded witness of that majesty. 

> _I am circling around God,  
> Around the ancient tower.  
> And I've been circling for thousand years,  
> and I still don't know if I'm a falcon, or storm, or a great song. -- pg 179_

…

#### Becoming an ancestor -- being claimed, failing to claim

Becoming an ancestor is the consequence of being claimed by your successors after your death.

What does this suggest about our efforts (or lack there of) to claim our ancestors? 
And who we claim or don't of our lineage? 
And what example we might be setting for the generations who would be the one claiming us after we're gone?


> So how do you become an ancestor? See, the unwelcome suspicion is actually lodged in the formulation of the question. You have to become an ancestor, by dying, and by being claimed by some of the living as a worthy precedent. In other words, the fix is not in. You won’t inevitably become an ancestor. -- pg 199

…

#### Pg 209 - Lyrics to a song about a boy’s relationship with his mother (death of parents)

The song struck me, as it spoke to the kind of loneliness and longing there is in being a boy in relationship to Mother/women.   
It’s exploration of the journey into supporting one’s mother in ailment, age, and death was also quite moving.

A bit of the song I was really moved by:

> And then it ends. And she goes to the ground. Or to the flame. And the old hurt comes on. And you’re left decide what everything means. Well, it means that you're an old orphan now. That's what it means. That kind of love life has for you is so confusing for the clearest running of hearts. And a man's heart with his mother dead is not one of those. There is an electrical storm that breaks out in the mind when parents die.

…

#### The Meaning of Sincere-No Wax

The crux of this is that the word sincere means “no wax” which is reference to the use of a special kind of wax used in stone carving. There is a kind of marble that is of the highest grade, finest grain, most expensive, that allows for a lot of fine details. Then there is “the poor man’s marble” which has a lower grade, coarser grain, which doesn’t allow for fine details because it carves in chunks. A kind of wax was used when working with this kind of marble to cover up the chunks leftover from using the cheap stone, to mimic that finer marble, to cover up its flaws and pretend it was of the highest grade all a long. “No Wax” of sincere refers to this

> ‘Sin’ is the Latin prefix for ‘without’ or ‘not’ or ‘un;, and then ‘cere’ is the word for ‘wax’. ‘Sincere’ could be read to mean ‘no wax’. There was an old practice of tinting wax with dust in such a way to cover the holes in the travertine [cheap] marble, so that it looked like a rich man's marble from a distance. The quality of being sincere has nothing to do with your motivation. Nothing at all. The quality of being sincere maybe that your holes show. That's the attribute. It's really wonderful. The beautiful thing about a lack of sincerity is: ‘oops your holes are showing’. Either way, you're being sincere in spite of yourself. -- pg 224

>[!warning] Uncertain  
> To be honest, though, I don’t really understand what he is saying here.  
The last part of the quote seems contradictory. If sincere means no wax as in your holes show, then how does a lack of sincerity suggest that your holes are showing? Or did he mean that no wax of sincere infer that no wax was showing because none was used, you are purely who you are as you present, and a lack of which infers that there is wax, which reveals one is attempting to hide their holes by presenting as if they aren’t there? The presence of wax shows there are holes. That latter interpretation makes more sense, but it really isn’t immediately clear in the way it is presented, so I am guessing based on what makes more logical sense.

…

#### What young people deserve from the old is an example of how to age gracefully

This connects with his perspective that our aging (and our dying) is something done not for "me" as much as it is something that we do that is truly for those who follow us. Not just in indirect the example of simply how we do be, but also in what that *how* enables in us insofar as wisdom we can offer explicitly to those who follow us, such that they might be enabled to do the same. 

And, that one way we shirk this responsibility is by attempting to pretend or avoid the fact that we are aging, and this is deeply selfish.

> I think it was James Hillman, bless him, who may have come up with this: the mark of getting older is learning how to pay the price more gracefully. There's no question about paying the price, but the refusal to pay the price of aging paints you in the corner of being deeply ungenerous, deeply ungiving, deeply self-infatuated, and it's a cause and a source of remarkable degrees of misery for those people around you. So what do young people deserve from you as you get older? An opportunity to see what grace under pressure actually looks like. Grace is not being untouched by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It's learning how to register their mark upon you. And how to bend so as to not break, so that when the final snap comes, it's not a thunderous thing. The final snap is just a little twig, because you've bent, you've had so much suppleness come to you to replace the physical agility that you want relied upon. -- pg. 231

…

#### Christmas, poverty in ritual, letting the old die is making a new

This is a long section of the book, starting on page 234, that explores KAJ’s uncertainty of the role of the Christmas tree in their family’s life. Whereas it was important to her mother, and not to her, so what of her daughter? Does she continue the tradition simply because? Does she let it go, and if so what goes in it’s place? 

Jenkinson goes on to explore what the younger generation may be seeing in their parent’s generation with respect to what world it has left for them, and where that generation got what it was offered, and what it was offered and then invited the consideration of whether of not that younger generation needs more of what was given to their parents, or something more like the example of letting that go in order to reveal how empty it all actually was in order to allow the poverty there become the basis of something richer (At least, that’s my read of it).

…

#### A living Ceremony

I think this is actually a quote from [[@jenkinsonGenerationWorthSpirit2021]]
This is a piece I would like to follow up on in the actual book. 

It has to do again with Christmas, ceremony, and things regarding maturity and growing up and raising kids. I am having a hard time parsing what it means, or what it is I want to not about it. So I am instead making this meta-note here.

> A ceremony is a living thing, or it is a museum, or it is therapy. There are other choices. But those are the big three at the moment. Let's go with ‘living thing’. That means that a ceremony needs sustenance, nourishment, the way all living things do. That pretty much takes care of the ‘I go to a ceremony to get my shit straight’, and the like. It's not a vending machine, not a juice bar, not tox, not detox. A living being called up by our calling out, and our willingness to assemble: that’s ceremony. -- pg 239

…

#### The value and meaning and etiquette

Another piece from [[@jenkinsonGenerationWorthSpirit2021]]

I read this as something like etiquette as a choreography for meeting strangers (and the stranger-ness of each other) that allows us to dance with that otherness in ways that enable connection, import, and meaning, without losing the otherness to an illusion of sameness.

I like how he mentions it a constraint upon infinity because, although excess constraint can be stifling and at time literally oppressive, as so much of the modern individualized self orbits around _anything and everything, whenever_ which not only tends to translate out into unreasonably selfish expectation of the world to accord to our every (so-called) “authentic” whim, but also too puts crippling pressure on the self to create the entire syllabus of every aspect of the meaning of everything.

Something about how his sense of etiquette makes it seem like a liberating structure that enables a greater capacity to derive and enact a meaningful life, personally and through our impact on others. And, given that one’s death seems to be a stranger in the midst that etiquette would guide us to meet, a meaningful death as well.

> Etiquette: not a popular notion. The reactive, uninitiated part of the culture hear’s control, ‘tyranny’. But etiquette is a language, a repertoire of gesture and stillness, inflection and timing and silence. It is afforded you not so you can say anything, but so that you can say something, and say well, and say it in a way that you can live with without defending later on.
> 
> Etiquette is the constraint upon infinity which is the presence of another person. Etiquette is the way by which all that is beyond you cares for you. It gives you a hint of your limits. Hemmed in by them, you appear. Later, you might see them from the grace-borne chance that they are to get the ending of things right, your own ending among them. Your own ancestors come into the proceedings through the etiquette you practice and submit to.-- pg 243

> […] the invitation to us all is to recognize that it was only with the advent of the stranger in our midst that the best of our culture, in the form of how we were with strangers, became available to us.
> 
> As long as we trade on kinship and sameness and affinity as the roots of culture, the best of us tends not to come forward. The more formal we are with strangers, the more likely the best of us comes creeping along those formalities and into the light. -- pg 245

…

#### Etiquette as the spiritual exercise of an animist

Here it seems he is suggesting, from the place of being an animist, that etiquette applies to in how we meet the many expressions of life in and as this world as well. This links to the “Approach and Regard” premise in DL

> The world is alive. All things in the world are alive too. You as a human have no market for conscious consciousness or alertness cornered. You do, on the other hand, though, have an obligation to conduct yourself with a degree of recognition of the aliveness of the world that you are the beneficiary of, not the owner of. So etiquette is, to my mind, the spiritual exercise of an animist. Yes, it's very formal. Because you do want it to communicate your regard, yeah. So you don't have the market cornered on the content of what’s communicated. But the willingness to undertake the etiquette is the great gift you have to give. -- pg 244

…

#### Grievance and certainty

Prior to this quote he comparing grief to grievance and outlines grief as something that compromises certainty, and righteously so. But that grievances are all about certainties, and it seems as though it is their certainties that affirm their own existence.

> Grievances are prejudices, unexamined, warranted, chiefly by their own persistence, taking a mistaking their entropy for necessity.

I don’t understand that final point about entropy. He doesn’t explain it further either and I can’t really wrap my head around it.

…

#### On the specificity of wisdom to a generation

I believe he is proposing that a generation’s wisdom is always tied to that generations “sprit work” and that such wisdom is non-transferrable. It is context-specific, and it must be translated in order to be applied out of that context. When it is not translated, it will no longer be wisdom once out of context, and will instead morph into something more insidious. 

> Wisdom is so particular to a generation’s spirit work, that, uninterpreted, it doesn't fit another generations, time and troubles. Untranslated, it wouldn't be recognizable as wisdom. It would start looking like aphorism or fable or cautionary tale, or orthodoxy, or new religion. It be a victim of deconstructed situation ethics. Unlaboured over, minus the exegetical devotions it deserves, one generation’s wisdom could become another's neuroses, or trauma, or tyrant.

This connects with my note on [[The generational fact of wisdom]]
