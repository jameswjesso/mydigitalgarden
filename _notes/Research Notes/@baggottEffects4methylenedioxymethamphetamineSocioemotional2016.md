##### MDMA increases the vividness and intensity of positive feelings with respect to positive memories; and reduces the perceived sense of intensity of negativity in negative or painful memories.

> Carhart-Harris et al. (2014) found that participants cued to remember positive memories after MDMA rated them as significantly more positive, vivid, and emotionally intense, while worst memories were rated as less negative, compared to memories after placebo. We hypothesized that autobiographical descriptions of positively and negatively valenced memories might reveal MDMA-induced changes in processing of autobiographical memories including participants feeling increased comfort and insight when recounting these events.—(Baggott et al., 2016, p. 379)

##### MDMA increases a positive sense of self and decreases social anxiety with respect to being negatively evaluated by others.

> We found that MDMA simultaneously positively altered evaluation of the self (i.e. increasing feelings of authenticity) while decreasing concerns about negative evaluation by others (i.e. decreasing social—(Baggott et al., 2016, p. 383)

##### MDMA increases anxiety that leads to the impulse to care for/about others.  
  
MDMA increases openness to others and positive feelings about oneself, but also increases self-reported anxiety.  
  
The authors propose that this anxiety drives us towards closeness with others (like an anxiousness that says "oh no, we need to care for these relationships because if not something bad will happen", (which I assume would include our relationships with ourselves.)  
  
Something like the fawning or tend-and-befriend response


> We found that MDMA increased self-report anxiety, as had been previously seen in some studies, but also decreased social anxiety, which is a novel finding in humans.—(Baggott et al., 2016, p. 385)

> This pattern is inconsistent with the idea that MDMA is a general anxiolytic. However, it is consistent with the possibility that MDMA may facilitate an affiliative “tend-and-befriend” style of response to stressors. This alternative to the prototypical male “fight or flight” response involves stress-induced caregiving and prosocial behavior—(Baggott et al., 2016, p. 385)
