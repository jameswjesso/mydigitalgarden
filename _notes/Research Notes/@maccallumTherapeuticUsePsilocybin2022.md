## Notes

#### Psilocybin conversion into psilocybin and pharmacokinetics of elimination

Psilocybin is converted into psilocybin in the stomach via stomach acid, and whatever is left over is then further converted through the presence of alkaline phosphatase in the bold, intestines, and kidneys.

> Following oral ingestion, psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated via the acidic environment of the stomach into psilocin. Any remaining psilocybin is then converted in the intestines, blood, and kidneys through alkaline phosphatase to produce the active, lipophilic form, psilocin—(MacCallum et al., 2022, p. 3)

#### Psilocybin dose response curve

Dose response of psilocybin being peak effects at 60-90min, onset at 20-40min, with a full arc of active effect between 4-6 hours .

> of action at 20-40 min, peak subjective effects at 60–90 min and an active duration of 4–6 h—(MacCallum et al., 2022, p. 3)

  
....  

#### The three phases of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy

Outlining that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has three phases with different goals and methods, pre, peri, and post.  

Preparation, journey, and integration.

> Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy focuses on three stages: pretreatment, treatment, and posttreatment (56). Pre-treatment heavily focuses on building therapeutic rapport and trust (56).  
> One fundamental therapeutic concept is that of “set and setting” which refers to appropriate patient preparation so that they are informed on what to expect during their session both from a mindset and environmental perspective. Treatment sessions are generally conducted in a non-directive, supportive setting and utilize a variety of tools such as a music playlist, meditation, and breath work (56, 57). Posttreatment focuses on supporting the integration of experiences (56)—(MacCallum et al., 2022, p. 4)

#### Psilocybin interactions with Antidepressants

Psilocybin interaction, TCA increase.  
Maoi-a and SSRI decrease.  
(According to [[@malcolmAntidepressantsPsychedelicsInteractions|Malcolm]], maoi-b increases effects)

> For example, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may increase the intensity, while monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may decrease the intensity—(MacCallum et al., 2022, p. 5)

  
....  

#### UGT inhibitor medications might negatively impact efficacy of psilocybin, such as diclofenac and probenecid

> As psilocin is primarily metabolized by UGT 1A10 and 1A9 (23), medications that can inhibit or induce these enzymes must be held or tapered prior to administration of psilocybin. Some examples of UGT 1A10/1A9 inhibitors include diclofenac (a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and probenecid (a uric acid reducer).—(MacCallum et al., 2022, p. 5)
