>[!Abstract]
> Like other cells, fungal hyphae show exquisite sensitivity to their environment. This reactiveness is demonstrated at many levels, from changes in the form of the hypha resulting from alterations in patterns of exocytosis, to membrane excitation, and mechanisms of wound repair. Growing hyphae detect ridges on surfaces and respond to restrictions in their physical space. These are expressions of cellular consciousness. Fungal mycelia show decision-making and alter their developmental patterns in response to interactions with other organisms. Mycelia may even be capable of spatial recognition and learning coupled with a facility for short-term memory. Now is a fruitful time to recognize the study of fungal ethology as a distinctive discipline within mycology.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> 
This paper outlines the various examples of cognitive and perceptual intelligence capacities as expressed by fungi, in particular their hyphae. The proposal is that given these various intelligence capacities and the manner through which they are expressed in the organism, we might consider fungi as having not only consciousness, but a conscious experience within each of it many hyphae tips.

## Notes

#### Mycelia may be capable of spatial recognition and short term memory


> Mycelia may even be capable of spatial recognition and learning coupled with a facility for short-term memory.—(Money, 2021, p. 257)

#### The Theory of Cellular consciousness

This theory presents that cells have their own expression and experiences of consciousness, and that human consciousness represent only an expression of a particular kind of consciousness along a much wider continuum of consciousness. 

> Arthur Reber (2019) has championed the cellular basis of consciousness and has made powerful arguments against the illogical privilege that has been accorded to human consciousness. Rather than seeing the human mind as a unique product of evolution, Reber regards our consciousness as one expression of irritability along a continuum of complexity. He is one of several scientists who propose that consciousness emerges from the perception of environmental conditions, discrimination between helpful and harmful stimuli, and other universal features of cellular behavior.—(Money, 2021, p. 258)

#### The detailed shape of a mycelia network (hypae branch geometry) as an expression of fungi decision-making.

The shape of a mycelial network is not a given, but a responsiveness to the environment within which that mycelia is developing. The shape it inevitably takes is an expression of the various hyphae making decisions about how to engage that environment over time.

> On a simpler level, fungi express the same kind of individualistic behavior all the time. Because the precise timing and position of branch emergence from a hypha varies, every germling assumes a unique shape (Hewitt et al., 2016). This stochastic quality of development is evident from the shape of clonal colonies growing on a surface and is amplified when the hyphae proliferate in three dimensions. Although there is a high degree of predictability in the overall time-dependent form of the emerging fungus, it seems likely that its detailed shape is irreproducible. These behavioral differences arise from something akin to decision-making: the location of a branch is determined by its point of emergence on the circumference of the primary hypha and the timing of its inception.—(Money, 2021, p. 258)

#### Fungi consciousness as a "product" of interaction between genetic inclination and responsiveness to the environment.  

He presents fungi consciousness as a "product" of interaction between genetic inclination and responsiveness to their environment.  
  
*I am not personally a fan of consciousness as a product, but instead more like a meaningness alive in the dynamics between parts that contribute to the whole of those parts, making it greater than the sum of those parts.*

> Consciousness is a product of the interaction between the genetic controls that underlie this developmental process and the responsiveness of the fungus to the physical environment. The fungus is not thinking in the sense that a brained animal thinks, but some of the underlying cellular processes of signal transduction are bound to be homologous.—(Money, 2021, p. 258)

  
....  

#### The mycelium network as a colony of interconnected units of hyphae consciousness

> If individual hyphae are conscious, what happens when an interconnected colony, or mycelium, of thousands of these cells forms in the soil? 1 Is a mycelium more than a sum of its parts? Can it be regarded as an integrated conscious entity?—(Money, 2021, p. 258)

  
....  
#### The wood wide web is a useful metaphor, but is ultimately a disservice to the actual brilliance of mycelial networks and their role in forest ecosystems.

> Studies on mycelia and mycorrhizas have encouraged the concept of the forest as a kind of super-organism with a “wood wide net” formulated by fungal connections between trees. This awkward allusion to the World Wide Web has some usefulness as a metaphor, and is an attention grabber, but it does a disservice to the fungi.—(Money, 2021, p. 258)
....  
> This rich behavioral repertoire allows fungi to adapt in real time to changes in environmental circumstances. Our internet shows none of this inherent flexibility. It is a network of pathways that generates nothing on its own. Life outshines the limitations of this drab technology in every cell.—(Money, 2021, p. 258)
