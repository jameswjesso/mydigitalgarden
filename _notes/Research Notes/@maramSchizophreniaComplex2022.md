## Summary

This book is heavily jungian and is discussing the impact that the illness and diagnosis of schizophrenia has on people. Not so much the illness itself, but its impact on individuals, relationships, families, communities, etc.

> The schizophrenia complex as I conceptualize it, *is not the phenomenon of schizophrenia itself viewed as a complex,* but concerns the emotionally charged thoughts and feelings generated in response to the schizophrenic condition. - pg1

A big portion of that impact being related to our socially conditioned fear of the condition, which is spoken to as an extension of our fear of the unconscious. But also our fear of the impact schizophrenia has on us as people socially, the alienation and judgement that we know we would feel and also feel against others, all of which activates a complex that projects/defends/fawns/etc.

She suggests that schizophrenia is the victory of chaos over order and the eroding of the ego by a flood of material from the unconscious mind. That people’s experience becomes overwhelmed by unconscious content (affective and narrativized) from the collective unconscious and their conscious ego mind is broken and overwhelmed. She often used the metaphor of flood and ocean.

Also too then, the fear against schizophrenia is based on the recognition that we all are ego’s holding the walls necessary for our navigation of reality and are all subject to unconscious content. We generally access it as mediated by the ego. But we also all know that the unconscious is such that it could overwhelm us and we see that potential and what would come of is in the example of those with schizophrenia—the annihilation of our ego and the loss of who we are to the overwhelming expanse of chaos. So we fear that too, we fear that possibility and those with schizophrenia bring it to our attention, and a complex can get activated to protect that all that too.

Comes from her personal story with her adult son who had a psychotic break in his early 20s.  

**COMMENTS**  

It laboured on this a bit too much about her and her son and it was hard for me to parse how much of this was good academic work and how much of it was personal catharsis. I would say about 20-30% of the book seemed to me as obtuse. But, that also might be because I was a not a huge fan of all the long deep dives into various myths, which I assume is common in Jungian works (although maybe because it felt like more laboured on than was relevant to support the thesis… I don’t know.)

## Introduction

Schizophrenia is a diagnostic category where in psychosis is its “hallmark symptom.” - pg 4

### Chapter 1

Jung described a schizophrenia or psychotic complex in contrast to what he called normal or neurotic complexes. The difference being that a neurotic/normal complex included elements of the unconscious that were coherent enough to be accessible to one’s ego (central identity complex) and a psychotic complex included elements of the unconscious that are entirely “split off” or “disassociated” from the ego.

Jung’s presentation of a schizophrenic complex was that the person with symptoms was the one with the complex.

Maram’s presentation though is that it is those impacted by an encounter with schizophrenia that are triggered into the complex.

That is to say those who have loved ones who have schizophrenia and are experiencing the impact of that; those who went through the psychotic episodes and are now with enough stability and clarity to recognize the impact their episodes has had on their lives and relationships now and into the future—primarily extreme alienation—as well as the impact it has had on others; even people who encounter others with schizophrenia who they have no relationship with but are triggered by it. These are all different expressions of Maram’s Schizophrenia complex

> Schizophrenia itself is not a complex. What we call schizophrenia involves incursions from the unconscious, affective and energetic experience disconnected from consciousness. In contrast, the schizophrenia complex as I am describing it has to do with the thoughts and emotions that arrive from a *conscious* experience of encountering schizophrenia. Thus, the complex can occur in an individual who has suffered psychosis themselves and recovered enough ego-consciousness to recall, reflect upon, and retrieve ego-associated affect with some insight. The complex is also triggered in others whose lives are impacted by those who suffer schizophrenia. The ramifications of schizophrenia range from intensely personal to collective: family, loved ones, community, and the world at large. - pg 27

A main trigger for schizophrenia complex is that of loss of one’s stable sense of self, or ego. When we encounter someone in delusion or with schizophrenia in general, it confronts us with the fear of annihilation. That is with who we think we are, and all that we think is real, and the stability of that being completely subverted to the point wherein that “me” being entirely gone.

> The ego has the job of adapting to both inner and outer existence. The maintenance of adequate ego stability has great bearing upon one's ability to keep the balance between consciousness and the unconscious, including a working relationship with the self. With schizophrenia, that balance is burst asunder. Unconscious contents impinge upon waking reality, threatening the stasis of conscious experience. Even the idea of such an experience, let alone an immediate encounter with it, understandably has the power to rattle our equilibrium. - pg29

### A Justifiable Fear

This chapter seemed to be exploring how our fear of schizophrenia and resulting complex is not unwarranted. It represents what Maram called potentially “a psychic dissolution that is not in service to individuation at all but a leap into nothing for nothing—at least not for a part of our existence that we can known or own”. Fear of that potential is warranted and even healthy, as being engulfed by the force we are fearful of represents of total annihilation of the ego consciousness we “work hard for, need, count on.” It is legitimate that we would have reasons to be triggered to resist and avoid it. (pg 48)

There are parts os us that prioritize towards healthy individuation and parts of us that incline towards madness. We all have these and they represent an archetypal challenge in our psyches at all times: the balance between order and chaos. Total loss to chaos comes with consequences to order (and thus our ego-developed and interpersonal lives) that makes that makes total chaos dangerous warranting an emotional response that prioritizes us away from it.

> ”We humans are inherently confronted with the dramatic opposite of order and chaos in the challenge to regulate the interplay between ego development and the unconscious, in ways both personal and collective. One difference between the archetype of contents of the collective consciousness and other content, such as those of the personal unconscious, is it sometimes walls are lifesaving. While "" walls" may have a negative connotation, as though we are avoiding something that should be included her face, boundaries and differentiation are generally acknowledged as positive functions, helping us to keep things—keep ourselves—together.” = 51

It gets complicated though when that fear triggers a complex that blocks us from offering good care those we love who are suffering from schizophrenia. Furthermore, that it causes us to begin a kind of madness-inducing fear of madness in us. A vigilance that becomes an iteration of the very thing it is efforting to protect us from.

There was a lot of talk about Jung intentionally exploring this as an example of trying to dive those depths while maintaining balance between the archetypal opposites of chaos and order.

### chapter 4 Jung’s history with schizophrenia

apparently, Carl Jung , early in his career, was deeply involved in a hospital that was treating psychotic patients. He was working with two other doctors and his experiences there had a significant influence on this development of complexes, and the discovery of the collective unconscious. Those doctors were Eugene, Bleuler and Emil Kraepelin

> jung’s seminal complex theory emerged from his work with the word Association experiments during this period. He and his colleague, Franz Riklin Sr performed experiments on patients who are both normal and psychotic within the psychiatric hospital Young, eventually propose that complexes were seen in all human beings, but those who are “normal”, and those with schizophrenia. -58

part of Jung‘s contribution to the research on schizophrenia was in supporting Eugene, Bleuler in an hypothesis that presented psychotic patient’s delusions, as being something of meaning, wherein the established theory at the time was that they were a byproduct of a form of early neurological degeneration. (That was the theory of Emil Kraepelin) 

> The discovery, that schizophrenic delusions were something of meaning, emerging from complexes, that all humans share, created a shift in understanding the disorder. The author writes “Jung’ observation suggested that when we may perceive people with schizophrenia as different in kind, they are but different in degree. “ 61



### chapter 5 theories about schizophrenia

this chapter listed out the historical arc of various theories about schizophrenia relevant to their impact on people impacted directly and indirectly on by the illness and presents her criticism of the present day, materialist, biological psychiatric theory of schizophrenia, and the resulting treatment.   

> chronic mental illness certainly is a brain disease, but that explains a little, since everything is the brain – not just psychosis, but our deeply irrational love for our spouses and children, for example. To end our understanding and inquiry about schizophrenia, by defining it as a “brain disease“ diminishes the other vital dimensions of what makes us human: our perceptions, our emotional intelligence, our souls. That reductive attitude posits that essentially nothing is real unless we can measure it.  - 7

### chapter 6 chemical implications: the solutio

this chapter outlines various alchemy terms and concepts and theories, as a metaphorical representation of how the conscious minds encounter with the unconscious mInd can destabilize a person. It utilizes alchemy as a way of explaining the phenomenon of schizophrenia, so as to help those of us who do not have it be more understanding when and why it triggers our schizophrenia complex  

I found it, like a number of sections of this book, to be very heavy headed and bloated  might be more so because I don’t really care about Al chemical explanation, but it also comes up with much of the excessive exploration of mythology.

> The alchemical dimensions of schizophrenia help to explain the potentially overwhelming archetypal scope of its meaning for us psychologically and emotionally - 77

This quote outlines what it is about the dissolution process of schizophrenia that’s so terrifying. It’s not the dissolution itself seems problematic, as dissolution can very much be a part of a generative process. The issue arises as this particular expression of dissolution feels both permanent and in opposition to growth

> with schizophrenia, dissolution is terrifying because we assume it must mean irrevocable loss rather than a step in a growth process — 84

Hopelessness is a defensive response against the feeling of what is asked of us to show up to a particular thing, that which we are hopeless towards, it’s so great that it is easier to feel hopeless than it is to feel out of control, and it is easier to feel hopeless than it is to make any kind of effort emotionally or through action that will ultimately turn out to be ineffective, that’s protecting us from the disappointment

> hopelessness helps us avoid feeling out of control and risking disappointment. 85

### chapter 7 schizophrenia, the role of affect, and mythology

it used mythology as a example of our, each one of us, propensity and capacity for unrestrained affective chaos, and the ordering function of consciousness, ego consciousness, to protect from the consequences of that Chaos having unrestrained reign.   

One quote that did feel worth holding onto here though,

> our emotional responses to schizophrenia reflect our relationship with the unconscious and our concerns about our ability to regulate affect with some sort of ordered cognition. We are challenged to find a balanced relationship with both our ego consciousness and the unconscious. Our wariness about encountering schizophrenia may manifest our wariness about our own capacity to self regulate, our private doubts and fears about finding the necessary ordering within to marshal our own inner chaotic elements  

A critique I have about this perspective, is the lack of acknowledging how legitimate fear and concern is in this kind of scenario. Fear for that person safety for our own safety for the safety of others around this person who is being overtaken by the chaos of the unconscious. It makes it seem as though all of this complex is just us and our fears of the unknown, rather than there being some reasonable element of clearheaded assessment of Danger. 


### chapter 8 psychotropic medication and affect

she essentially outlines why it is that she supports medication as a response to schizophrenia. Even though she wants to be able to support a non-medicated response, she just does not see that as being realistic. My language.

She does however outline the consequences of this medication very much being late dampening for dad and one of the persons affective encounters with the world. But also presents that it is a reasonable and necessary price to pay for stability. I’m not sure I agree, if open dialogue is as effective as it presents itself to be. But outside of the advocacy of something like that, I also see medication is being an important and valuable tool to support people with this condition.

##### People who are in a full psychosis feel strongly that they do not need the intervention , that actually nothing is wrong.  

The term for this is anosognosia “Lack of insight”

> getting someone to take medication initially is all but impossible, since a characteristic symptom of psychosis is the gut level, firm conviction that they absolutely do not need help or intervention. …  is a symptom of severe mental illness that impairs a persons ability to understand and perceive his or her illness. It is the single largest reason why people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder refuse medication’s or do not seek treatment. -99



### chapter 9 The schizophrenia complex in a fairytale: the three Billy goats gruff

This chapter outlined the story of the three billy goats gruff as an example of how a strong ego function can help manage and maintain order —health and stability—in the face of the chaos of the unconscious. The whole premise was to outline an example that explores the role of the ego in this respect, which she called ego consolidation (although it was never clear to me what ego consolidation itself meant).

> Of everything I have witnessed and undergone with my son, but emerges centrally is the overwriting importance of a strong, developed core ego and navigating the chaos of schizophrenia—and the glaring difference when the ego is flooded […]. Ego consolidation is fundamentally prerequisite to compensate for the sake of chaos the characterizes schizophrenia. - 103

### Chapter 10 the schizophrenia complex and therapy

This discussed her work with clients that had schizophrenia, focusing on two different clients. The latter one was very impactful.  

There was a generally theme of having a theoretical basis for understanding schizophrenia as the ego being overtaken by contents of the unconscious, but it focused less on the treatment (although that was in there, about how given that person a space to feel safe and un-judged in order to build relational trust and rapport while also getting to speak through and out their delusions) it had a strong focus on how the schizophrenia complex was activated in the clinicians and the impact those client has on those clinicians lives.

I am not sure what else to say on this as it seems to be strongly based in Jungian analysis which I don’t have a background in, so the aspect of treatment that are implied are lost on me.

> In terms of actual clinical practice, however, while learning theories inarguably prerequisite, our capacity to respond to the unique needs of each individual client phenomenologically is nowhere more relevant—and precious—then when dealing with what we call schizophrenia in all its many manifestations. According to Perry, "the most fragmented ‘thought disorder’ can become quite coherent and orderly within a few days if there is someone at hand to respond to it in the spirit of a real, honest, and warm relatedness.” 116

### chapter 11 the schizophrenia complex: archetypal roots in the role of eros

This chapter was a bit of a summary, although I really didn't feel like it offered much to the book as a whole or even really felt like an explicit summary (it was the last chapter, and the actually conclusion was more about her and her son than the book’s content).

This quote below, though, seemed to sum up her theory of schizophrenia from a Jungian perspective

> In someone without schizophrenia, unconscious feelings and emotions are potentially accessible to ego consciousness, where they can be negotiated. However, for someone with schizophrenia, the ego is flooded, overtaken with archetypal contents of the collective unconscious. In such a state, rather than there being an overlap in which unconscious contents are access, processed, and navigated by an incorporating, governing ego, there is no middle ground but only water. - 142

### Questions

What is a complex?

What is schizophrenia? What are some of the prevailing theories that have been presented over the course of history?

What is the schizophrenia complex? Different between Jung and You.  
Medication vs not medication ( her stance is yes medication ) but also.. what of this kind of quote?

> Chronic mental illness certainly is a brain disease, but that explains a little, since everything is the brain-not just psychosis better deeply a rational love for our spouses and children, for example. To end our understanding and inquiry about schizophrenia by defining it as a “brain disease” diminishes the other vital dimensions of what makes us human: our perceptions, our emotional intelligence, our souls. That reductive attitude posits that essentially nothing is real unless we can measure it. - 70
