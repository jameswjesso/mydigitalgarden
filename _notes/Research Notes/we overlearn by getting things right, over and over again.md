**we overlearn by getting things right, over and over again**

Once we have gone through the subjective and neurological process of establishing the pathways within us that allow for getting things right, we then progress to getting them right over and over and over again.

Essentially, we keep doing it even after we are in a place with that learning process that we are no longer actually improving, just repeating what we already are able to do at the same level of difficulty. 

This process helps to lock in the pathways we created through our learning/mistake making process.

My sense is that this process can apply to affective or dispositional states (e.g. Aristotelian virtues) as much as it might to juggling or playing the guitar.
