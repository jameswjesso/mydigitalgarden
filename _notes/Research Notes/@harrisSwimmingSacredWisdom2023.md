## Summary

Harris interviewed several underground females guides who have been doing this work for at least 20years (with a couple less than that). She explores what it is that they are doing and compares and contrasts it to the history of psychedelics in the West and the modern renaissance/gold rush for psychedelic therapy. 

Also, she compares what these guides do to therapy, on the presentation that what they do is NOT therapy, but guiding others into and through visionary realms with the assistance of unseen others. There a number of differences she outlines—such as training length, experience, perspective, etc—that left me feeling growing concern for the oncoming rush of new therapists that will be IMO undertrained for what they are leading people into.

She also attempts to couch the specifics of the worldviews (worldings) and practice of these women in modern and historical research, hard science and philosophy, on everything from unseen others, practicing for dying, and therapy in general as well as the navigating psychedelic experiences.

Additionally, she provides a chapter on integration that offered a  nice theoretical basis of understandings what integration is and means (but without any specific practices).

There was also a focus on telling the stories of women who were essential in the history of psychedelics in the West but left out of that history due to old sexual bias against women. This was very insightful.

The phrase of swimming in the sacred is in reference to the time-in that these women have invested into visionary experience and dedicated attention to the development of their skills as a guide. 

It left me feeling refreshed at the perspective as it seemed grounded into a much more realistic perspective on what it takes to groc this space enough so to lead others.

## NOTES

##### Gorgeous introduction

>I yearn for the spaciousness of the sky to enter into my heart and carry me into the celestial realms. —([Harris, 2023, p. xvii](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=18&annotation=2ITYG8AT))

##### The work of underground guides might be therapeutic, but it isn't therapy

What they offer is something different than therapists as they help the client travel through realms beyond us, based on their experience of having done so themselves. There is a greater connection to the intuitive and energetic, both with the client but with unseen worlds and allies. 


> The underground guides might be therapeutic but they are not therapists. They travel to other worlds, cultivate unseen allies, guide journeys, and bring their clients home safely. Their primary relationship is with their personal healing spirits, plant teachers, ancestors, unseen forces of nature. Not many therapists would describe their work in quite this same way.—([Harris, 2023, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=24&annotation=7TQS9TMD))

....  

##### psychedelic Integration requires something deeper than the conceptual

DL there is something deeper than thinking in integration, in learning with psychedelics.  

> She isn’t just thinking about it — she’s osmosing it, mulling it over, experi- encing a felt sense of it. Whatever is working on her is alive in her body, requiring attention, moving the furniture around in her psyche—([Harris, 2023, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=28&annotation=G7ULG6JV))

....  

##### Narcissists aren’t evil as they don’t intentionally cause harm.

> Evil is when people cause intentional harm. Narcissists typically do harm unintentionally, without any empathy for the damage they inflict on others. That’s not the same as being evil—([Harris, 2023, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=29&annotation=5T5MENV3))

....  

##### Important Women contributors not represented in the history of psychedelics in the West

There is a question here about “herstory” and the lack of initial and somewhat prevailing representation of women in psychedelic discourse

> Women had achieved the vote but they still didn’t have a voice, not even within the psychedelic subculture undergoing a cultural and spiritual “awakening.”—([Harris, 2023, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=35&annotation=I69CVZV3))

....  

##### Offering tissues as a kind of suppression (client work)

Offering tissues during tears as a kind of subtle encouragement to clean up and finish.

> You can stop someone from crying by simply handing them a box of Kleenex. Women are less likely to get in between the person and their experience.—([Harris, 2023, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=36&annotation=S4Y8YK7Y))

....  

> Being silent and unseen triggers the cultural experience of being mansplained or just plain ignored, not unlike Kendra Smith who said “no one seemed interested” in her experience. It’s as if these women are twice silenced — by both gender issues and drug laws. I identify with having no voice in a myr- iad of smaller ways, and I very much want them to have their say, even though they must remain anonymous—([Harris, 2023, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=36&annotation=IJVSZSZD))

....  
**NOTE**

I am noticing some discomfort, or resistance to a kind of woke feel to this text—mostly in its uses of the term "patriarchy"—and concern as to how it will play out in an interview.  

This is at odds with a recognition of the omission of women from merited places history and especially the history of psychedelic science and cultural discussion and this being an expressions of what we know of as the patriarchy. 

([Harris, 2023, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9))

##### Swimming in the sacred, the years of deep immersion in far out psychedelics realms, and the ceremonial spaces of this world

I am noticing myself measuring myself up here.

> They have journeyed far beyond my capacity. They have certainty in their connection to unseen sources of guidance. They have physical and spiritual stamina and fearlessness. I have questions and anxieties. I am not of their ilk. Trust me, I am not belittling myself or presenting a fake modesty. I know my limits and where my gifts lie. These women who swim in the sacred are beyond me.—([Harris, 2023, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=41&annotation=VBFXB582))

....  

##### Comparing the suppression of nature-based beliefs in childhood to psychological assessments for delusion in adult, e.g. communicating with plants

This is reminding me that one of the questions on the psychological assessment I did the other day was whether not I believed I could communicate with plants, talk to plants, and I knew that I needed answered no to this question because if I answered yes it would Have been assessed as delusional.

> When I was little, I thought I could talk to trees. Then later I was told, ‘No, you can’t talk to trees.’ I never mentioned it again, and now, of course, I know I can talk to trees.”—([Harris, 2023, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=52&annotation=7UGRU56V))

....  

##### A narrative exercise that tracks your spiritual experiences (writing prompt)

Doing a narrative exercise of tracking all the spiritual like experiences you had in your life from childhood, offering a kind of alternative set of milestones around which to build the narrative or autobiography, alternative to easier to remember difficulties, or traumas.

> I recently did an autobiographical exercise that built on the central role of spiritual experiences throughout a lifetime, starting with childhood. I wrote down every mystical, numi- nous experience I’ve had over the course of my life. Looking over the list, I realized these experiences told a personal story quite different from my outworn narrative of all the traumas and abuses I’ve experienced, mostly from men—([Harris, 2023, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=55&annotation=EEIZVY2C))

##### Thinking of Wade

I am thinking of my experience with wade

([Harris, 2023, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9))

....  

##### Psychedelic guides holds skillful center as their client treads deep in experience (client work)

A key skill of psychedelic guidance is being able to maintain a kind of equilibrium while treading deep experiences of those in your care. Too much empathy gets you tangled in. 

This connects for me this idea of [[Compassion vs empathy]]

>  She describes her- self as “constitutionally able to meet people in deep waters and maintain my own equilibrium.” This capacity is a prerequisite for a psychedelic guide, one that I don’t have, I might add. Not only do I get scared, but I lose my center, my equilibrium, by overempathizing with the person in a psychedelic crisis. My boundaries are too porous, too open. This is a real asset as a psychotherapist but not for—([Harris, 2023, p. 44](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=63&annotation=LTQLVKMM))

....  



##### The foundational role of Al Hubbard in the practice of psychedelic therapy today

Al Hubbard was an original LSD psychedelic guy, he influenced the use of high Dorsey’s for religious experiences, he influenced Osmund and came up with set and setting(not those terms), focusing inward, and perhaps even using eyeshades!, as well as specifically selected music. In many ways he lay the ground work for psychedelic therapy as we know it today.

> Hubbard originated the importance of set and setting, even though he didn’t call it that, as essential for a psychedelic experience.—([Harris, 2023, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=68&annotation=HT2SZ46T))

....  
> Before Hubbard’s arrival, “no special effort was made to control the environment of the patient under- going (psychedelic) therapy. Hospital rooms or psychiatrists’ offices were used and there were many environmental distrac- tions which interfered with the patient’s experience.”29—([Harris, 2023, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=68&annotation=5HBPS8WH))

> Eyeshades were not used in the beginning, but a 1953 photo shows a towel draped over a person’s eyes during a journey.32 Jim Fadiman thinks it was Hubbard who first came up with the idea of put- ting something over the eyes to help the person focus inward.33 Hubbard’s use of eyeshades was also confirmed by Tania Manning, who asked Connie Littlefield, director of Hofmann’s Potion.  
> 
> Connie interviewed psychedelic pioneer Myron Stolaroff and psychiatrist Oscar Janiger and reported that they credit Hubbard with the introduction of flowers, a mirror for self-confrontation, personal photos, and eyeshades— music to soothe the traveler through rocky transitions and to evoke a mystical response. He found that a mirror and family photos could be used to facilitate self-reflection—([Harris, 2023, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=69&annotation=KWZDDRQF))

....


> His insight to turn inward during a psychedelic journey, aris- ing from his childhood spiritual experiences, continues to be the basis for the current research protocol. The comfy room with inspirational music, flowers, religious art, and eyeshades is still the setting for psychedelic research sessions almost sev- enty years after Hubbard’s initial explorations—([Harris, 2023, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=71&annotation=EZD47THY))

....  

##### Modern psychedelic therapy is orphaned from the wisdom of the underground therapy and practices that have been ongoing for decades.

> Jeffrey Guss is a psychiatrist working with a New York University team using psilocybin with terminally ill patients, and he said, “We’re isolated from all the wisdom and knowledge in the underground community. That vast uncollected experience contains details about the medicines’ potential and pitfalls, challenges and inconsistencies — the variety of ways psychedelics might wholly, drastically change a life.”44—([Harris, 2023, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=73&annotation=U3DD6HII))


....  

##### Apprenticeship is learning through osmosis

Apprenticeship is a kind of learning through an osmosis possible due to the proximity and depth of closeness to the work of a master. It is explicitly but also implicit, into the nervous system.

> An apprenticeship is of a whole differ- ent order. It’s literally sitting at the elbow of an acknowledged elder, learning the craft or art by being present, osmosing the subtle skills to work with energy in the moment. Anthropol- ogist Francis Huxley apprenticed with a Brazilian healer and described the intimacy necessary for the process of transmis- sion: “You have to get their way of seeing into your own sys- tem.”2 This characterizes the implicit learning that takes place when the student is in the teacher’s energy field as the teacher works.—([Harris, 2023, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=77&annotation=ACKWZQQB))

....  

##### Apprenticeship in psychedelic work is working through an attunement between teacher and student.

> There’s a subtle merging of images as guides accompany their students through entheogenic realms and track their progress. The teacher tunes in to the student, and the student learns to resonate with the teacher, and infor- mation is transmitted nonverbally through this attunement.—([Harris, 2023, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=77&annotation=PJ55RZ75))

....  

##### It is important to not the difference in determining qualification between underground guides and modern therapists

> My point is that the psychedelic field needs to make the distinction between how the newly hatched psychedelic therapists are being trained and how the elder guides learned in apprenticeships—([Harris, 2023, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=78&annotation=Y8RJTG5H))

....  


##### Giving a combination of medicines to someone when you haven’t experienced that combination yourselves is a serious misstep.  

> One woman reported being reprimanded early on by her teacher for offering a combination of medicines she hadn’t yet experienced herself. This was evidently a serious misstep. She was told she couldn’t guide anyone for twelve months, and she accepted this consequence—([Harris, 2023, p. 60](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=79&annotation=2JY9WQPN))

....  

##### Follow your destiny or die.

> There is a belief that you follow your destiny or you die. These women had the strength and courage to follow their destiny before they fully understood the entire path. They had faith in their own unfolding. This is the essence of a journey, whether an entheogenic time-limited ceremony or a lifelong destiny.—([Harris, 2023, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=83&annotation=STWZZ52W))

....  


##### Indigenous vs western guides' goals in psychedelic training

Indigenous apprenticeship is about becoming a shaman, western is about learning to healing with expanded states. Neither are about therapy or being therapists.

> With an indigenous teacher, the apprenticeship is about becoming a shaman or curandera. With a Western teacher, the apprenticeship is more about healing in expanded states, not about becoming a psychedelic ther- apist, which is what the current training programs promise.—([Harris, 2023, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=84&annotation=FEDEE3IP))




##### Further insight into the contrast with modern professional certification/training.

> Stolaroff said Zeff “was blessed with an abundance of heart, the most necessary prerequisite for someone accompa- nying others into the depths of their very souls.”7 Unfortunately, this quality of heart is difficult to operationalize, and current psychedelic therapy training programs only require a professional license. Some training programs to be a psyche- delic guide don’t even require that, and Oregon is considering “training” people with a minimum of a high school educa- tion — a far cry from the psychedelic elders I interviewed and a farther cry from the Eleusinian priestesses.—([Harris, 2023, p. 67](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=86&annotation=SS7KT738))

....  


##### Even the most experienced journeyers are confronted with challenges in experience that are difficult to integrate.

I know this to be true of my own experience, and even my most recent one at the time of writing (may 20 2023), where the mushrooms reminded me that just because I am experienced, just because I have been in it for a long time, doesn't make me any different. I can still get rocked and struggle.

> This occurred even though Ann was a seasoned traveler who experimented regularly with a variety of chemical concoctions that her hus- band Sasha Shulgin produced in his lab. It’s humbling to know that no matter how experienced someone is, they can have a disintegrating journey with disturbing aftereffects.—([Harris, 2023, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=87&annotation=LJL95RW4))

....  

##### An example of helping a person who is struggling post journey with distressingly a projection experience (disassociation)

An example of helping a person who is struggling post journey with distressingly a projection experience. Turn it back unto them, develop a relationship with it, and encourage trust in the process unfolding. Don’t get in its ways.

> Zeff said, “Whatever you’re facing is not out there, it’s inside you.…You’re just going to have to accept the fact that some kind of process is taking place which needs to take place and there’s only one thing you can do, must do, and that is: don’t get in its way.…I can assure you that you’ll be out of it by the end of the week.”—([Harris, 2023, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=88&annotation=VKMKGN8B))

....  

##### "Just" look at it. Phrase (client work)

Something to consider saying to clients. Just look at it, something that helps get around the suggestion of surrender. The looking is neutral and doesn’t require any special feeling tone, and the just is a suggestion that it is simple and not more is required. Just is repeated.  


> Look at what you’re afraid of, just look at it; don’t do anything about it, just look at it. Just keep looking at it and just tell me what you experience when you’re looking at it.”10 This seems like a simple suggestion, but there’s a complexity inherent in his message. The advice translates to “don’t resist,” but that word- ing would not be helpful. First of all, it’s much harder to stop doing something, to stop resisting, when we’ve already begun to spiral down into fear. Zeff ’s suggestion instead redirects the person’s attention to something they can do, “just look.”—([Harris, 2023, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=89&annotation=9P22UDGL))

....  
##### Some basic rules to agree to before guiding.  (client work )
…   
> Leo Zeff outlined the agreements he re- quired before he was willing to accompany someone on their journey:12 
> 1. They will not leave without my clearance.  
> 2\. There will be no physical harm or violence.  
> 3\. They will not reveal where or with whom they had the journey.  
> 4\. No sex, absolutely no sex.  
> 5\. They will do what I say.  
> 
> Sixty years later and three decades after Zeff ’s death, his apprentice Medridth described these same agreements in her own words, proving that my mother was correct when she told me, “People live on in the hearts of others.” 

> 1. You’re putting your life in my hands and I have final say so.  
> 2\. We’re going to other worlds. I keep you safe in this world.  
> 3\. No sex. No danger like standing on your head.  
> 4\. Confidentiality.  
> 5\. Agreement to do what I say.  
> I repeat these basic rules for guiding for two reasons.—([Harris, 2023, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=90&annotation=NDAU2FG7))

....  

##### The energetic connection and exchange between sitter and client (client work)

There is a subtle exchange between sitter and journeyer which makes the journeyers inner experience permeable to sitters inner state and thus caution must be had to ensure the sitter is as Centred in their role and their presence with their clients experience as they want their client to be to that experience.

> For instance, if the guide tends toward anxiety or fear, the journeyer is likely to catch it like a virus. There’s a loosening of the boundary between client and guide, so they easily pick up on one another whether they’re intending to or not. In the del- icate state midjourney, there are inevitably enough challenging moments without the client being contaminated by the guide’s emotional state—([Harris, 2023, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=95&annotation=TJSZRWKJ))

....  

##### The guide must do their own work, or their lack of it will contaminate their clients journey

The vital importance of a guide doing their own work is that if not the work of the clement will trigger them and lead to a contamination of the clients process.

> If the guide’s unresolved issues are stimulated in a session, this can cloud the experience and exhaust the energy required to rise to challenges in either person—([Harris, 2023, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=95&annotation=VWM8TJQW))

....  

##### The only way to learn to be a guide is to be guided, over a long term, years and years.

> The only way to learn how to guide is to be guided by an experienced guide, and so we arrive full circle at the necessity of a long apprenticeship. Not a training, whether over months or a year, whether in person or virtual — an adoption is what’s needed, an accompaniment through unknown territories, on low and very high doses, with all of the entheogens21—([Harris, 2023, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=96&annotation=AZCEKWBH))

....  

##### The three stages of initiation 

Comparing this to myself from the car accident, I definitely feel myself coming into stage 3.

> With an anthropologist’s perspective, Cedar talked about the process of initiations occurring over a lifetime with the traditional three stages: 
> 1. Dissolution, disrepair, coming apart, separation from what was known before.  
> 2\. Limbo, liminal stage, ordeals, challenges, requiring perseverance.  
> 3\. Integration, movement into new level or status, contribution to the community.—([Harris, 2023, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=98&annotation=BJIYZDCZ))

....  
Giving numinous experiences opportunities to work on the person over time.

> A numinous experience should be left untouched, honored and respected from afar. It has its own way of working through a person, healing and changing them as the experience deepens and moves through their inner life. This is why a psychedelic guide or therapist has to have their own experiences in these other realms, inner and outer, to know when to sit in silence and “just” be present to the whole, mysterious unfolding.—([Harris, 2023, p. 82-83](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=101&annotation=8LJLKG4P))

....  

##### To be present while sitting for a journey is to be in presence to something larger and call that presence into your presence with the other. (client work)

Sitting in presence is not only an act done to be present to your client, but a simultaneous act of being in presence of something larger from where you are present to your client

> Jamie Beachy, director of the Center for Contemplative Chaplaincy at Naropa Univer- sity, does the best job describing being present: “Presence, for me, [is] about being connected to something that is broader than myself.…So when I bring my presence, I’m also mediat- ing something greater than myself.”24—([Harris, 2023, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=103&annotation=XCLUN7E6))

....  

> This means paying attention with an open, receptive focus. I have heard of guides, sitting nearby, available and yet immersed in a book. I don’t think this qualifies as the kind of presence I’m suggesting.—([Harris, 2023, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=103&annotation=JHTAERPY))

....  

##### Sitting for a client required being grounded in one's own body

Sitting for a client required being grounded in one's own body, acting as a kind of grounding rod for your client through resonance and attunement

> The guide needs to be grounded in her own body in order to focus on the person in front of her. She has to sift through what she’s picking up directly in her felt bodily sense and dif- ferentiate what belongs to her client and what’s hers. She has to recognize and manage her own projections so the client has a free, open psychic space without interference—([Harris, 2023, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=103&annotation=QRHPW2WQ))

##### Jung had a female guide in the journeys that led to The Red Book, Toni Wolff

This was never publicly acknowledged, although she was his support through the experiences he wrote of in his Red Book

> Carl Jung dove deeply into the unconscious, he had a woman guide, Toni Wolff,—([Harris, 2023, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=105&annotation=HCV7QFIZ))

Jung developed active imagination with Wolff

> During this time of descent, Jung and Wolff together developed the technique of active imagination, in which the patient is encouraged to engage in dialogue with images from dreams or visions.32 This is precisely what Arielle did when she asked the spirit o—([Harris, 2023, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=107&annotation=VU8U33WB))

....  


##### Asking if the voice is real is the wrong question

Asking if the voice is real is the wrong question as you will never get a clear answer and it just serves to confuse. 

> I have to confess that I continue fruitlessly to ask the wrong question again and again: “Is this voice I hear real in the outer world or a projection from within me?” It was with great relief that I discovered that Saint Augustine expressed the same bewilderment in 387 CE in his Soliloquies in a dialogue with “Reason.” He wrote: “When I had been pondering many different thoughts to myself for a long time, and had for many days been seeking my own self and what my own good was, and what evil was to be avoided, there suddenly spoke to me — what was it? I myself or someone else, inside or outside me?”—([Harris, 2023, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=107&annotation=2VAIUGD2))

##### Provide grounding foods on reintegration (client work)

> The spirits told me to give my people grounding food after the ceremony — nuts, cheese, dark chocolate, fresh or dry fruit, or warm soup. To welcome them home.” In my interview with Janet, we s—([Harris, 2023, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=108&annotation=4XIDIQ5Z))

....  

##### Asking for support helps plant spirits offer it.

>Thirty- five of the fifty-four said they called upon the spirit of aya-huasca for help, support, guidance, and love.

###### Developing a relationship with plant teachers evolves over time, and is reciprocal 

The process of developing a relationship with the unseen other is plant teachers and helpers. This is something developed over time and exists beyond the direct effects of the plants biochemical properties. It is reciprocal, too, meaning that there is something they will ask of you at some point.

##### personal commentary on Harris being too humble

I believe she holds herself maybe too humble here, not giving herself enough credit. But perhaps that is a kind of reverence I am seeing play out, for these women elders and through them the larger forces present in and through the work they do.

> when we’re caught in our egos  — thinking, I’m right. You shouldn’t have.…Then we have to disidentify with our position and find a way to reach across the chasm our reactivity has created. Quite a bit of emotional intelligence is needed, which, unfortunately, often eludes me—([Harris, 2023, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=124&annotation=RE4G2Z65))

##### Trait absorption, "thin veils" and being overdosed | value of lower doses

Discussion here about how some people have “thin veils” and are thus more sensitive to being over dosed, this might correspond with trait absorption. There is too a praising of the value of lower doses and the egotism in goal orienting to high dosing.

> Cedar, however, said, “I have been overwhelmed by the physiological effects of high doses — what might even be con- sidered ‘normal’ by some. I’ve learned from such experiences that low doses allow me to fly just as deep and for at least as long as others.” Two other very experienced voices from the sixties agree. Mountain Girl, or Carolyn Adams Garcia, who traveled with both the Merry Pranksters and the Grateful Dead, said, “The egotistical lunge toward high doses is not a good idea.…More is not better. It really isn’t. That’s my biggest message.”44—([Harris, 2023, p. 111](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=130&annotation=WQRASUW5))

##### The panic just before the first wave is normal, lean in

The panic that steps in just before things go full steam, the first moment we are challenged to surrender. This is normal, trust and be courageous, lean in.

> I daresay every psychedelic elder has experienced this panic, either in themselves or in their clients. There comes a moment in the journey when the challenge is to let go, surrender, and trust the medicine and the guide. Often this is the moment right before ego dissolution. At this moment, the guide has to hold steady, rooted in her own experience.  
> The best advice for this moment th—([Harris, 2023, p. 113](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=132&annotation=56GIT2DD))

##### It is the relationship that matters above the effects of the drug, when it come to the healing potential of psychedelics.

> The psychedelic women elders deeply understand that their work is all about their ongoing relationships with unseen others. It’s the relationship, not the drug. I do understand why the academic research teams can’t talk about guidance from unseen others. However, these ongoing relationships are cen- tral to healing and to the spiritual nature of these medicines. The medicalization of psychedelics is losing this spiritual core—([Harris, 2023, p. 114](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=133&annotation=Q8W5X4UC))

##### Over trusting your visions and discerning what is vision and what is ego projection

> Discern what’s yours and what’s not yours, and then manage it with discipline and ethical behavior. This is learned through the apprentice relationship over a long—([Harris, 2023, p. 117](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=136&annotation=C3HZ4RRE))


....  

##### Learning to tell the difference between ego and wisdom

It is ultimately extremely difficult to tell the difference between ego projection and wisdom, and thus structures that ensure no harm comes of our actions (or that they are at least ethical) is essential to ensure that if it turns out that what we acted on was ego projection, the consequence is only a lost opportunity.

> Lest this appear too simple, I have to add that others, far wiser than I, have acknowledged that there is no clear-cut formula for discerning between divine inspiration and ego—([Harris, 2023, p. 118](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=137&annotation=SQ7FLLGQ))

> Janet Adler, teacher of Authentic Movement, which is a therapeutic process almost totally based on subtlety close to a mystical awareness, stated, “Intuitive knowing can, in fact, be projection.” And if that warning isn’t enough, Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, a Jungian psychologist and teacher of Sufism, cautioned, “There are no rules for this work of discrimination except the simple practice of sincerity and self-awareness.”—([Harris, 2023, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=138&annotation=LAUJJ2V3))

##### Where do we go when we enter the visionary realms? 

Where do we go when we enter the visionary realms? Perhaps we go no where but wake up to where we have always been, fish seeing the water. Yet still, ultimately, it is Mystery.

> I’ve asked a lot of experienced travelers, “Where do you go when you journey?” No one knows but the best answer was, “There’s no there, there.” Yes, it’s a mystery, but these are the visionary realms. They are ever-present and timeless; they interpenetrate with consensus reality. In the same way that fish don’t realize they live in water, we don’t realize we live in visionary realms. It’s not that we travel to these realms; we wake up in these realms. And the psychedelic elders, with their thinner veils, swim in these waters.—([Harris, 2023, p. 122](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=141&annotation=S67PKDIQ))

##### how prepared modern psychedelic therapists will be for the actual work.

> Most of the current generation of psychedelic therapists do not have the extensive personal experience that the underground elders do. They do not have years of ecstatic and challenging journeys and all the in-between ones. They simply haven’t had and don’t have the time to explore. The current batch of psychedelic therapists are needed immediately as these medicines become available to a general public awash in depression and anxiety.—([Harris, 2023, p. 129](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=148&annotation=VZFTJVE2))

....  

##### Whether or not a psychedelic therapist should consume the psychedelic they provide is a none-sensical question

The ongoing question, discussion as to whether or not the psychedelic therapist should experience the psychedelics themselves seems nonsensical to those who have been practising on the underground, those who have a code of ethics that includes never serving something to someone you have not experienced yourself.

> There’s even some current professional discussion about whether or not psychedelic therapists need to have their own journeys. This would certainly seem nonsensical to the underground elders, as part of their code of ethics is never to serve a medicine they haven’t personally experienced—([Harris, 2023, p. 129](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=148&annotation=9YX9XXP9))

##### The process level learning of psychedelic insights

Part of the psychedelic experience is a learning process, not only about the contact, but the process level. Part of the journey with psychedelics is learning how to learn from psychedelics, it’s a process only done achieved through time in, and support by those with that time in.

> I had to look up the word: heuristic means to discover or learn something for oneself, as in experiential learning. What better description could there be for what happens during and after a psychedelic journey? So much emphasis has been placed recently on ego dissolution, complete mystical experience, and emotional breakthrough that we’re overlooking an essential process—([Harris, 2023, p. 130](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=149&annotation=4EDQRGZ6))

....  

##### Cleaning up our personal past is essential for spiritual growth through psychedelics 

The work of cleaning up our past, learning our defensive patterns, and increasing the skillfullness with which we relate with other is an essential ingredient to all healing, including psychedelic work. If we don’t do that added level of work, then all the spiritual experiences we can handle won’t prevent us from harming others and ourselves in those other issues played out in out lives.

> As a psychotherapist, however, I have to add that this level of responsibility builds on a foundation of therapeutic work regarding parents, external conditions, and exes where we learn to recognize our defensive patterns, emotional constrictions, and rigidities. This is ongoing work as our self-awareness and objectivity develop. We cannot skip this foundational level of work via spiritual bypassing. This is the most common mistake in working therapeutically with entheogens. Spiritual experi- ences don’t necessarily lead to ethical behavior, and if we don’t clean up our personal history, we are likely to act out old issues in ways that are harmful to others as well as ourselves—([Harris, 2023, p. 135](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=154&annotation=Y5IZ2HID))

> A teacher of “orphan wisdom,” Stephen Jenkinson wrote in Die Wise, “Dying changes what life means if you are will- ing.…You can change how you understand your life.…I’ve taught for years that dying must be allowed to change every- thing. You might think it inevitable that dying has that power, but a couple of decades in the death trade persuaded me with- out doubt that there is nothing inevitable about it. It is enor- mously hard work, to get your dying to tell your life’s story.”34—([Harris, 2023, p. 142](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=161&annotation=GVILXTVC))

##### Psychedelic therapy in dying time helps to quell issues of demoralization, and the resulting depression and suicidality

Psychedelic therapy in dying time helps to quell issues of demoralization, and the resulting depression and suicidality. Something about connecting beyond ourselves helps us contextualize our pain and dying as a part of something that does mean us harm, malice, or insult. It simply is, and is part of something simply beautiful too.

> Demoralization is associated with higher levels of discom- fort and pain, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The psilocybin journeys were seen as a spiritual intervention to ease demoralization as death approached. The study authors wrote: “Access to the transpersonal realm has the potential to alter a terminal cancer patient’s perspective to their existential suffering.”—([Harris, 2023, p. 143](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=162&annotation=W36E6YRF))

##### The fetishizing of the ego-death/mystical experience obfuscates the value of other levels of psychedelic experience

The ego dissolution mystical experience priory triggered by the research and pollen allure people into the mistaken perception that it is this experience specifically (and exclusively ) has value.

> In contrast with the research studies, which use a cost-effective treatment approach to a psy- chiatric diagnosis, the women guides work with the medicines as part of the sacred journey of life. In fact, I’ve heard a few of them complain about people coming to them specifically to have a mystical experience. For example, Janet explained, “Since Michael Pollan’s book came out, I get calls from people looking for a mushroom sitter. Just reading the research results from Johns Hopkins and elsewhere, it’s easy to have unrealistic expectations.” Nothing, of course, is guaranteed.  
> There are a plethora of other experiences that can arise during an entheogenic journey that have been overlooked. In this chapter, I’m interested in experiences that have to do with the skin-ego or the boundary between inner and outer—([Harris, 2023, p. 149](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=168&annotation=K9KP78ID))

##### somatic empathy, intuition, and somatic dsicernment

Intuition and knowing how to respond and show up to client in a psychedelic session is led by a kind of somatic discernment. Intuition arises in he body first, we then cognitively assess whether or not it’s appropriate to follow though, but it begins in the felt sense of the body.  

This emerges out of somatic empathy which is qualitatively and neurologically different than cognitive empathy.

> The elders’ intuition is rooted in their somatic sensing — they just know; they feel it in their bones. They receive mes- sages from plant teachers, spirits. Yes, they pause to cognitively reflect on their intuition, deciding whether to go with it, to wait, or to ignore it. All are good possibilities and an example of integration of different states of knowing. But the source arises from within. For example, as I mentioned earlier, Rose said, “In ceremony, if my ego comes up, the medicine will say, That’s your ego. Feel it in your body.” That’s a sense of somatic discernment.—([Harris, 2023, p. 154](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=173&annotation=47H9SDAA))

> This may seem like a small linguistic difference, but when working with the subtle sensing of our interior being, it’s a wholly different process. Watts’s instructions evoke a cognitive response in terms of location and label. This is not the same as shepherding the person into their interoceptive mode, which is what Gendlin’s inviting vagueness does.—([Harris, 2023, p. 155](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=174&annotation=Y57SHSF9))

##### Surrender is not a single act

##### Healing Childhood wounds it’s not the same as erasing childhood wounds. 

Those wounds, they never really go away, not completely. They come back and arrive and arise and influence moments in our lives over and over again, throughout our lives. This doesn’t this happens no matter how many psychedelic journeys we have for therapy sessions. And this is normal, therapy and healing it’s not about making things go away, it’s about learning what why where how and overtime shifting how these things show up in our lives, and how they impact our lives, but how we respond to them when they arise, and eventually opening ourselves to let our wounds be lessons that opened our hearts,

> The hope or hype is that psychedelic integration will heal our old traumas, but that’s not the same as erasing childhood wounds. We encounter our lifetime scars again and again no matter how many journeys or how much psychotherapy we do. The intention should be to learn to recognize our patterns so they don’t dominate our lives and, hopefully, invite them in for tea, as Ram Dass so famously recommended. We can develop compassion for our brokenness and carry those exiled pieces of ourselves in our hearts, where they can crack us open to a larger love. In this way our childhood wounds become our teachers—([Harris, 2023, p. 170](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=189&annotation=Q2B3HM3H))

Are you in therapy now? Do you have supervision or consultation with other therapists? Do you sometimes share something about yourself in a therapy session that’s relevant, but without sharing too much?

##### The difference between reintegration and integration. 

noted here [[The difference between reintegration and integration]]

> The next level, which I refer to with a slight snarky into- nation, is what I call spa integration. Rest, walk in nature, write in your journal, get a massage, attend a yoga class. These are all good things to do, but they miss the opportunity to sift through an experience, to do the inner work necessary to reflect and mull over any personal messages and meanings that can emerge from a journey. Such insights or teachings need to be attended to in some way that preserves them for future reflection. If these thoughts are not recorded, they are like dreams that disappear by lunchtime, like gossamer threads that float away in the breeze. What was hard-won overnight can quickly become unavailable to conscious memory no mat- ter how relaxed the person is.—([Harris, 2023, p. 176](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=195&annotation=AL8YEFHW))

##### Ketamine rebound defensiveness

> there’s a rebound effect that some guides and therapists have begun to notice. Especially when working with ketamine, some people shut down immediately once the drug effect wears off. No matter how open and receptive they might have been during the journey, they revert right back to their defensive structure afterward. This is very frustrating for the therapists, who thought they were making “amazing progress” only to see the issues buried as deeply as before, with defenses hardened—([Harris, 2023, p. 176](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=195&annotation=AEKT5D95))

##### The value of the therapeutic relationship, the preparation and the integration

> The therapeutic relationship is the container for the jour- ney and should be considered a critical aspect of the setting.11 The continuity between the preparatory sessions, the cere- mony, and the follow-up sessions is crucial  — it establishes the relationship between guide and patient and encourages the connection from intention to insight to actions. The trust and support during the ceremony help the journeyer to let go during that crucial moment of surrender, and this can make the difference between a traumatizing journey and a mystical one.12—([Harris, 2023, p. 177](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=196&annotation=2ALZV8VR))

However, when I discussed the importance I was placing on the therapist-patient relationship, Amy Jones, an experienced psychedelic therapist, warned me, “I wonder if seeing the relationship as the healing mechanism might fuel a grandiosity in some that exacerbates the risk of falling out of balance.” This is a very important warn- ing. When a therapist becomes inflated, unethical behavior can follow; too often that means crossing boundaries or inappro- priate sexual behavior. Jones suggested that peer supervision, consultation, or just good friends could keep the psychedelic therapist “grounded and in moral alignment.” Her comment reminds me of the colleg—([Harris, 2023, p. 178](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=197&annotation=AEEN6UY6))

##### Journey memories are precious

These memories and their meaning are precious and can be tarnished by even well meaning but ignorant hands.

> If the therapist has not done enough inner exploration, they won’t have the fluidity or experience to recognize the psy- chic source of the client’s material. The therapist might mis- interpret a transpersonal experience as a personal one. This is one of the most common mistakes a therapist can make in psychedelic integration — such a misinterpretation can dis- rupt a therapeutic alliance at a deep level. The patient is shar- ing a very private experience, one they might have never told anyone for fear of being demeaned, misunderstood, or called crazy. The person feels as though they are placing their very soul in the hands of the therapist. If the therapist misinterprets this moment, the person will likely cut off such sharing and terminate therapy. That’s how strongly people feel about such misinterpretations.—([Harris, 2023, p. 181](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=200&annotation=DBR2FQV8))

Ernesto Spinelli stated his critique, “This struc- tural ‘thing-ification’ of our experience of being is expressed via the term the worldview.” He proposed the term worlding “to signify that mode of existence which is always-becoming, ever-shifting, process-like, and linguistically-elusive.”40—([Harris, 2023, p. 214](zotero://select/library/items/KSHJI3Y9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DVGXJWQU?page=233&annotation=JT2F5RRU))
