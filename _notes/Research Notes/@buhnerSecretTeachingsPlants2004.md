>[!Abstract]
> All ancient and indigenous peoples insisted their knowledge of plant medicines came from the plants themselves and not through trial-and-error experimentation. Less well known is that many Western peoples made this same assertion. There are, in fact, two modes of cognition available to all human beings--the brain-based linear and the heart-based holistic. The heart-centred mode of perception can be exceptionally accurate and detailed in its information gathering capacities if, as indigenous and ancient peoples asserted, the heart’s ability as an organ of perception is developed.
> 
> Author Stephen Harrod Buhner explores this second mode of perception in great detail through the work of numerous remarkable people, from Luther Burbank, who cultivated the majority of food plants we now take for granted, to the great German poet and scientist Goethe and his studies of the metamorphosis of plants. Buhner explores the commonalities among these individuals in their approach to learning from the plant world and outlines the specific steps involved. Readers will gain the tools necessary to gather information directly from the heart of Nature, to directly learn the medicinal uses of plants, to engage in diagnosis of disease, and to understand the soul-making process that such deep connection with the world engenders.


## Personal Summary

>[!...]
>
> *This book was a very important read for me back in about 2011, 2012. Re-reading it now I could see how much of it had just been sewn into my perceptions of things deep enough that I forgot it came from him. It was difficult and beautiful to read it again and to, validity of the science portion allowed to be less than perfectly correct, the essence of the book's call to open up our feelings as a form or perception while keeping a critical, self-appraisal and ongoing effort to learn, grow, own our projections and eat our shadow through developing a direct relationship to the living world is something I continue to hold a personally important and powerful invitation.*
> 
> *What follows is my VERY general outline of the things he presents with little to no substantiation from the actual text of the book, but all things here were explored and explained in detail.*
> 
>Buhner presents Nature as a complex self-organized living system, whose life is something that is greater than the sum of its parts. Within that, he speaks to how both Nature as a whole and all beings within Nature (all living beings) exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium, responding to internal and external variables in such a way to maintain the equilibrium necessary for its aliveness. (like a clown on a unicycle)
>
>He also outlines that all living beings and their living sub-units have an electromagnetic field and express electromagnetic frequency in their behaviour and organization. Wherein the perturbations of an organism's field contain information that can be decoded much like how radio encodes and decodes information in perturbations within a sine wave. These perturbations can be within the organism or from outside of it, and the exchange of the encoded information within those perturbations—both internally within organisms and externally between organisms—amounts to communication, to a kind of dialogue. And, that all communication and interaction within and between all organisms is, effectively, electromagnetic at its foundation, expressed through many potential forms of language (from biochemical to linguistic), and within those communications is meaning, with meaning as primary, language secondary.
>
>He proposes that humans are able to perceive this information through the perturbation of their own field, specifically the electromagnetic field of the heart which surrounds the body. He spends quite a bit of time exploring the heart as an organ, and eventually into it as an organ of perception (which was very interesting, and I was able to verify many, although not all, of his claims about how the heart does this)(. This mode of perception (heart-perception) is non-linear and feeling-based. Those feeling perceptions contain meaning, and from that meaning we can derive understandings about and from the organism (or life system) we are training that perception on. Essentially, it is through training your capacity to heart-perception/feeling-perception over analytical/cognitive perceptions, we can develop the capacity to communicate with plants through electromagnetic dialogue, manifest as feelings perceptions with derivable meanings.
>
>The development of these understandings and communication requires not only practising this mode of perception (something we can all do, and was once very common amongst humans, as we all evolved to exists in the electromagnetic reality of life on plant earth) but also the building of a relationship with that plant we are learning. This learning relationship evolves over time, with bursts of advancement at random, and eventually into a capacity to learn the "medicine" of the plant as we come to a point where the entire living being of the plant is manifest as whole within the imaginal space of our perception (imaginal being different from imagination). This is outlined and explained step by step at every level of the practice, throughout the book.
>
>This communication can go both ways, and we can send information (such as love, care, asks, needs, etc) to be perceived and received by the plant as we can perceive and receive their communications. (Of course, the process and perception is different on their end, but the communication, the dialogue is still possible).
>
>This same kind of perception can be used in healing practices to get clear signals from a clients field about their illness or issue, as well as to help guide their nervous system/field into a state of coherence (explained in depth in its chapter) through the healer embodying that state and the client entraining to it through sympathetic resonance.
>
>Finally, he proposes that as we practice this mode of cognition it is essential that we also be doing shadow work and self-analysis. This is because the meanings that arise in our communications will be from material in our own mind and, without knowing ourselves or being willing to confront our own issues, we will not be able to disentangle what was being revealed from the plant and what was just our own stuff coming up. He describes this something like feeling-perception is like turning towards a 3d mirror of ourselves, watching for perturbation in that reflection as the information, but that being that it is reflection that information not only offers us a first reflection, which is from the other, but a secondary reflection with is from and about ourselves. Those secondary reflections reveal things about ourselves to our conscious mind, through the communications with the plants. Things that it behooves and benefits us to work through. 
>
> And it is here that I believe is where the secret teachings of plants is, and it is that Buhner believes that in developing and practising this mode of perception, and the self-learning and transformation that is invites and enables in us while in direct relationship with the living world, we are guided (qualitatively) into changes in ourselves that are inspired by and accord to the living world. He is speaking to how we can thus learn a kind of morality from a direct relationship with life, while aligning ourselves, our self-construal, our perceptions, and behaviours in harmony with life, with Nature, through that direct relationship.

## Notes

### CHAPTER ONE  -- THE NONLINEARITY OF NATURE—(Buhner, 2004, p. 28)

#### Mathematics as a profession for control freaks

> Of course (though I did not know it then), the soul of the world cannot be found in philosophy, nor in the humanities, nor in mathematics, (nor even in science). It resides someplace else, someplace the linear mind cannot go.  
> 
> But to many people adrift, mathematics makes lover’s promises and offers a safe harbor from the storm. “Here,” it says, “are not only explanations, but a promise of total control.” The rules are straightforward and understandable; unpredictability vanishes.  
> 
> What about pi? And those few irritating things, like pi, as the mathematicians discovered, can simply be rounded off. (“Ve haf vays of making you behafe.”) Mathematics is almost always a profession for control freaks. It has little to do with life, very little to do with the real world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 29)

  
....  

#### Life is Non-Linear, The Wrinkled Edges of Coast Lines 

The wrinkled edges of the coast line are rounded off to fit it within the dream of Euclidean space. But the truth of it is much more complex, and truly does not fit.

> Eventually, even an ant will be too big to follow all the twists and turns and so perhaps we will have to imagine a microbe now traveling along the coast. Its size enables it to follow the coastline better still, and the line becomes, again, much more twisty and turny, and much, much longer—(Buhner, 2004, p. 32)

The wrinkled edges of nature, it’s like this too. Our models for it (as an IT, [[@buberThou1970|Buber]]) are approximations, we round the edges. And think we have it mapped, known, when what we really know is the convenience of our own interpretations, divorced for the reality of it.  

> Nature is like this. If you take any part of Nature and look at it, its edges will be ragged and twisty and not straight. So to measure parts of Nature, to make Nature accessible to linear—some would call it “practical”—thinking, all of us are taught to round off the edges, to create specific and distinct boundaries between one thing and the next. This in actuality only gives us an approximation, a guess. And no matter the power of our magnification, it remains only an estimation of the real.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 33)

As soon as we adopt a linear way of thinking to nature, all our observations to follow will not only be incorrect but increasingly separate from nature itself, because nature is not linear.

> The observer intervenes in any resultant description of Nature by subtly altering its description, a description that depends on a preference for one level of magnification over another. It is an error that is not rectifiable—not correctable—because the error comes from the way of thinking itself. It comes from applying a linear, static mode of cognition to a nonlinear, always changing and flowing reality—(Buhner, 2004, p. 34)

  
....  
#### Nature is immeasurable, because all measurement constrain reality into the confines of the subjective.  

Nature is immeasurable, because all measurement constrain reality into the confines of the subjective and Nature is greater than the confines placed upon it. Whatever pieces can be quantitatively measured can never add up to the whole, as the whole of Nature as a living thing is greater than the sum of its parts. 

> The truth is that in the real world, in Nature, quantification is always a projection of arbitrary human decisions. It is always subjective. Nature contains no fixed, measurable quantities.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 35)

  
....  
#### Outlining the unreality of the Euclidean planes

The reality described by Euclidean planes is a constraints placed up reality in order to make it manageable. Those constraints, however, are inventions meant to separate reality into pieces that don't exist beyond their creation through constraint. The consequence is that the living-ness of Nature is lost when its whole is seen through separating constraints.

> Euclid defined the dimensions of physical matter that we now take for granted: a point has no dimensions, a line one, a rectangle two, and a sphere three. But if you think about it, you have never seen a no dimensional, one dimensional, or two-dimensional form—they do not exist in Nature and they never have. They existed only in Euclid’s mind and now, regrettably, in ours.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 37)

.... 

> The truth is that what Euclid left out of his mathematical world was life.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 38)

....  
#### We cannot understand aspects of Nature if we divorce it from its context 

We can never understand something from nature if we separate it from its wild context to observe it. This is the great misunderstanding of reductionist science.

> Scientists, when focusing their research on one particular thing, take a picture, with the linear mind, of the moments and the movements of that living thing through (supposed) three-dimensional space. They separate it out and isolate it. They take a piece of Nature, remove it from the flow of life and time, and study it, trying to understand Nature and life or, perhaps —to them—more simply, the leaf of a plant. But once it is removed from its living context, broken off from the matrix within which it exists, it is no longer what they think it to be. This unnatural separation can never produce the outcome they desire, and everything they decide based on that separation will always end up wrong.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 41)

  
....  
#### The etymology of fractal and the implications that calling nature fractal illicit

> Mandelbrot created the term from the Latin word fractus, which means “something broken apart into irregular shapes.” Fractus is also the origin of the English words fraction and fragment. And so a fractal is something that has irregular, nonperiodic shape. That is, it is fractional, fragmented. (And this use of the word fraction or fractal to describe Nature evokes the fundamental realization that everything we see, including ourselves, is only a fractional part of one very large whole.)—(Buhner, 2004, p. 42)

  
....  
#### Dissection of Nature, for any purpose, requires us first to kill it in our mind

We must have let nature die in our minds to allow such dissection of it, literally and figuratively, to happen.

> For human cultures to allow scientists to dissect Nature as much as they have, Nature had to become a dead, unalive thing, otherwise no one would have put up with it.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 42)

  
....  
#### Semen is pollen, poem to example how language can alter us

> Semen is Latin for a dormant, fertilized, plant ovum— a seed. 
> Men’s ejaculate is chemically more akin to plant pollen. 
> See, it is really more accurate to call it mammal pollen.  
> To call it semen is to thrust an insanity deep inside our culture: 
> that men plow women and plant their seed when, in fact, what they are doing is pollinating flowers.
> Now.  
> Doesn’t that change everything between us?—(Buhner, 2004, p. 45)

  
....  
### CHAPTER TWO  -- THE SELF-ORGANIZATION OF LIFE—(Buhner, 2004, p. 46)


>[! Warning] re-reading this chapter would be helpful as it was a bit beyond me
>This chapter dealt a lot with fractals and self-organization and complexity in living systems and time. I would need to re-read this to be able to properly note it.
>> Self-organization initiates the fractalization of matter, emergent behaviors initiate the fractalization of time.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 51)

....  

#### The fractal organization and shape of Nature, of the self-similar wrinkled edges found the smaller down you look.

Buhner presents that Nature is organized fractally, that there are highly-irregular and non-linear but self-similar iterative patterns that can be seen in various expressions of Nature, from trees to coastlines to circulatory systems.

> Each series of smaller wrinkles will be found to be very similar in shape to the larger one you started with (see figure 1.1). This is true of all natural objects such as branching trees, coral formations, wrinkly coastlines, ragged mountain ranges, the heart and circulatory system, plant leaves, and the brain and central nervous system. Thus a fractal, to be even more precise, is a nonlinear object composed of subunits (and sub-subunits) that resemble the larger structure—(Buhner, 2004, p. 47)
> ...
> All fractal objects possess this property, known as self-similarity; while they are highly irregular, they also have patterns. —(Buhner, 2004, p. 47)


....  

#### Mountains are expressions of the organism of Nature as a whole.

He presents that although we can see things like mountains and water as not being living onto themselves, but containing living things, that they are actually living things in the sense that that are expressions of the whole of Nature itself as a living thing.

> These apparently static material forms, mountains and water, are the body and blood of a living ecosystem, the Earth, and can never be accurately viewed in isolation from the whole. They make up one complete, living organism.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 49)

  
....  

#### Life is the whole that is greater than the sum of it's parts

There is an emergent something that comes into being when complex systems self-organizes into functioning whole. Life is that emergent something, this is why it can never be found in the parts of it as its existence is an expression of the whole, which is greater than the sum of its parts.

> Life will never be found in the DNA nor any part of the whole. Life is the thing that is more than the sum of the parts, the thing that happens at the moment of self-organization, the nonlinear quality that comes into being at the moment of synchronicity—(Buhner, 2004, p. 50)

...
#### The reality of a self-organized system is inaccessible to the linear mind

His premise of the linear mind is that of the "parts+" analytical thinking. The way of thinking that labels, analyzes, and places things in order. The math of the quantifying mind. But the reality of self-organized systems is (as mention in the above note and in [[@buhnerSecretTeachingsPlants2004#Nature is immeasurable, because all measurement constrain reality into the confines of the subjective. |this note]]) something that cannot be measured or analyzed or concretized and the harder one tries to do so the further away one gets from that living reality. (or something like this) 

> The harder the linear mind tries to grasp this reality, the more slippery it becomes. A self-organized system is a living, ever changing identity that comes into being of its own accord in a gesture of acquiescence and cooperation that is never static—(Buhner, 2004, p. 52)

  
....  

#### Self-organization from complexity to a living system with emergent behaviour that maintains the dynamic equilibrium of that self-organization

Self-organization happens when the interrelation of various parts come together with enough complexity that they spontaneously enter a state of functioning together. At this point they become something new.

These self-organized systems can, too, come together to function as a coherent whole, wherein something new comes into being that is of greater complexity and greater than the sum of various self-organized systems that comprise it. 

> These kinds of spontaneously self-organized systems occur at many levels of complexity in living organisms. A system at one level of complexity—a molecule—can join together with others to form systems that self-organize at new levels of complexity, such as cells. When sufficient numbers of self-organized systems come together, all the self-organized groups will suddenly begin to synchronize and form one larger coherent unit. As groupings from each level join together to form new levels of complexity, entirely new types of self-organization occur, the form and behavior of which cannot be understood or predicted from any study of the preceding systems. To separate out and examine any one part of the whole in isolation—a cell or organ, for example—misses the point all over again. That tiny thing that occurs at the moment of self-organization is more than the sum of the parts.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 52)

This point(threshold) wherein a collection of complex interactions between components becomes a self-organized system is never predictable. But, when it happens the system enters a state of dynamic equilibrium and coherent behaviour emerges out of what was once random interaction. That behaviour is related to the system maintaining that dynamic equilibrium in response to variables that would otherwise compromise it, like a clown balancing on a unicycle.

> At some never predictable point the increasing number of molecules crosses a threshold, beyond which occurs the moment of self-organization. On one side, there is nothing but randomized molecular movements, on the other sudden self-organization and emergent behavior. (This threshold line itself is not a like a fence line; it is, in fact, much like a coastline, and like a coastline its exact orientation in space and time ebbs and flows.) At the moment the threshold is crossed, at the moment when self-organization occurs, the new living system enters a state of dynamic equilibrium. And to maintain self-organization, the system constantly works to maintain that state of dynamic equilibrium, much like a clown balancing on a unicycle.
>  
> The information encoded within the perturbation tells the clown—at a level far below that of the conscious mind—exactly what that perturbation will do to his balance. His body understands the information and devises a complex, coordinated response of his entire being to maintain his equilibrium.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 54)
  


....  
#### Self-organized systems are living identities with perception and response 

These self-organized systems are living entities that are in a constant state of communication, both internally and externally, in order to maintain the coherent organization (dynamic equilibrium) that keeps that entity alive.

Because of this, no individual part will reveal the life of the whole system.

Additionally, coming to understand that system requires an observation of the communications that maintain it even more so that observing the system as an entity itself. 

This is because although the life of the thing is in the whole, that whole is composed of, and exists in a context (environmental, internal and external) and without that context we cannot grok the life of that system.

> Self-organized systems are living identities that engage in continual communication, both internal and external. They are not isolated, static units that can be understood in isolation. To examine them in isolation kills the living entity itself, and paying attention to the thing and not its communications—its balance-initiated information exchange—reveals very little about the true nature of what is being studied—(Buhner, 2004, p. 54)


Further, the emergent behaviour that maintains the dynamic equilibrium of the living system as a response to various stimuli that may compromise it is the result that that entities perception and intelligent response ([[Intelligence Definition|this is related to my intelligence definition here]]). 

> Anything a self-organized, living system detects—anything that touches it—affects its balance. And this stimulates the system to shift its functioning, however minutely, in order to maintain its dynamic equilibrium. All nonlinear systems—all living organisms—are like this.  



Much like maintaining balance, these stimuli introduce perturbations to the equilibrium, which amount to a kind of information that leads the system to respond in ways that maintain the equilibrium. That is the dynamic part, these systems are in a dynamic (non-static) responsive dance with variables(perturbations)—both internal and external—that would otherwise dis-balance the system and throw it out of the coherent synchronization it has achieved. 

> And what facilitates their ability to respond to the minute touches of the world upon them is that they are not in a permanent equilibrium, not in a static state of being. They are poised, powerfully balanced, held in dynamic tension from one tiny fractal moment to the next. There is no one state to which they return when they are disturbed. They are always shifting, altering themselves, always about to fall into disequilibrium from environmental perturbations and always reorganizing—reestablishing a dynamic equilibrium—in new ways.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 56)


The more complex the system, the more sensitive it is to perturbation and the more expressions we can find of this behaviour within that system. These perturbations can be mulit-factoral, but Buhner presents that they all, ultimately, come down to electromagnetic signals (explored in the next chapter's notes)

Buhner further states that these systems can be so complex and so sensitive that they can detect, response, and communicate through signals so weak (low amplitude) that we have yet the tools to detect them.  

> The more interacting elements there are, the more sensitive the living system becomes to any perturbations affecting its dynamic equilibrium.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 61)
...
> The more sensitive these systems are to even the weakest perturbation, the more they are able to enhance their stability. They can detect perturbations that are so subtle that scientists have insisted they are too weak to exert effects.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 62)


Further, that these systems can detect, response, and communicate signals "very near the theoretical limits that can be calculated for sensing weak signals from a noisy environment." In this case, I believe he is speaking to very large living systems, such as Old Growth Forests. 

> In fact, the sensory systems of living organisms operate very near the theoretical limits that can be calculated for sensing weak signals from a noisy environment. For one of the abilities of systems with long-range coherence is that they can detect much weaker signals than any individual component of that system. Further, they have the ability to enhance such signals.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 62)


  
....  
#### It is the meaning that matters, the form of the language is irrelevant
  
All languages are structurally organized systems for the conveyance of meaning, and although the central language of it all might be signal transduction, it is the meaning that ultimately matters.  

> Thus it is the information, the meaning encoded within the perturbation, that is important, not the form in which it is delivered. The form is merely one possible language of communication out of myriad possibilities. In the end it is the meaning inside the behavior that is significant, not the behavior itself. It is not the chemical released, nor the movement of the body, nor the electromagnetic field that is important, but the information, the meaning, that it carries—(Buhner, 2004, p. 57)

  
....  

#### The meaning of things is not in its parts but in the tension between the parts that makes it whole


> No matter how much you dissect the words and structure of the sentence you are reading now, such a study of its parts will never reveal its meaning. You may look at the history of language, how one word evolved into another or was combined with one from another continent through long interaction, study the function of verbs, adverbs (and their proliferation), nouns, adjectives, interjections, dangling participles, split infinitives, vowels and consonants, their shapes and sounds, proper pronunciation and articulation, but the meaning resides someplace else. It is embedded within the sentence, but it is not present in its parts. Those parts, in a sense, have “self-organized” to generate the meaning. The meaning is not the word, just as the territory is not the map. 
> 
> There is a tension between the words, something joining them together, a pattern that emerges into consciousness that is not contained within any of the parts when they are considered separately.   All life is like this. There is a tension between the parts, something connecting them together, a pattern that emerges into consciousness that is not contained within any of the parts when they are considered separately. And this something that is not in the parts is the whole ball of wax, the point, the complete shebang.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 58)

  
....  

#### Life emerges through the dynamic play between balance and imbalance on the edge of criticality.

Self-organized systems and the self-organized criticality (which is when they are on the constant verge of critical states, like the snow prior to an avalanche). Upon perturbation, the critical state they enter is a disequilibrium, which the self-organized system responds to in order to return to equilibrium. This dynamic is necessary, as it is in this dynamic that life (which is itself a self-organizes system) and all that comes of life expresses.  

> So cells, and all self-organized systems, wobble continuously between balance and imbalance. The self-organized systems we know as life, and the behaviors that come from them, could not exist without the delicate state of dynamic equilibrium that occurs between balance and imbalance. Life comes from the constant interaction between chaos and order. Without the dark, the light would have no meaning or purpose.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 60)

  
....  

#### Mitochondria and the evolution of individuality through the symbiosis between self-organized systems

The evolution of individuality emerges through symbiosis between self-organized systems, their coming together in collaboration that mutually benefits. This is how we got mitochondria.  

Over time, this continues to evolve into increasingly complex forms of self-organized systems, with increasing sensitivity to perturbation towards imbalance, thus increased nuance in capacity to respond.  
  
(according to Lynn Margulis)

> Margulis’s research showed that evolution is the emergence of individuality from the interblending of once independent organisms; that evolutionary novelty arises from symbiosis or the merged, mutual collaboration of different self-organized systems.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 61)


  
....  
#### Nothing living is static, it is always in flux and responsive dance with external stimuli  

Nothing living is static, it is always in flux and responsive dance with external stimuli.  

Even that which we see as dead, is permeated by life. And thus, even dead things, when within the system of life that gave it life, are still a part of a living system.

> No living system is static and unvarying. They all exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium whose exact shape and behavior alters from millisecond to millisecond in response to external perturbations. And millions upon millions of perturbations are occurring at any one moment in time to all living organisms.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 61)

  

  
....  

### CHAPTER THREE  --- THE ENERGETICS OF LIFE—(Buhner, 2004, p. 63)


....  
#### All life is embedded in the field of electromagnetic frequency and expressed in frequency with fractal irregularities

All life is embedded in the field of electromagnetic frequency, and all life expresses through that frequency, and those expressions are always fractal and irregular, like shore lines and mountains. Life expresses through the way it fractalizes the oscillations with the that frequency of the field it is expressing through.  
  
Like radio, there is a particular frequency channel (or band) one tunes into, and the information being send through that channel is revealed through the radio receiver's decoding of the information sent through that frequency.

> The electromagnetic spectrum is simply another facet of Universe, another dimension through which life can flow. And when life flows through the electromagnetic spectrum, when it flows through a particular frequency, it fractalizes it, just as other dimensional lines fractalize. The oscillating sine wave or broadband frequency that life flows through becomes a fractal and its edges take on the same kind of irregular shaping that solid objects do. Every time life flows through a frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum, it fractalizes that wave differently , because the flow of life is always nonlinear. What is interesting is that unique information is always embedded or encoded within the way the oscillating sine wave is fractalized.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 65)

#### The Flow of Life Fractalizes, embedding information

Life flowing through anything fractalizes that something, and those fractalizations (irregularities) embed information into that something, be it matter or frequency.

> Every time life flows through something, whether matter or a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it fractures it, turns it into a fractal. But the way in which life fractalizes whatever it flows through embeds unique information. (And these fractal lines are always in flux, no matter how solid a mountain appears.)—(Buhner, 2004, p. 65)

#### Living systems are broadband sensitive

Living systems are broadband sensitive. (meaning the entire electromagnetic range)

> Living organisms are extremely sensitive to all the different electromagnetic phenomena that exist, and they are able to decode the information embedded in every kind of fractalized wave they encounter . And everything that is has an electromagnetic dimension to its nature.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 66)

  
....  

#### Most of the signals encountered are ignored due to irrelevance, but when relevant the information from those signals can be decoded, communication

Most of the signals encountered are ignored due to irrelevance, but when they are relevant, then they catch the organisms attention, and from that attention information can be decoded from that frequency, which amounts to communication.

> Living organisms amplify these meaningful electromagnetic waves and decode them in order to hear them (just as we do). They then use the information and respond to the sender through their own uniquely fractalized electromagnetic communications. For all living organisms are transmitters as well as receivers; these communications always go both ways.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 66)

  
....  
#### The perception and communication of cells includes, but is not limited to, electromagnetic signal

Considering the language of cells, that is their ability to detect signals through the sensory organ of their membrane, and respond accordingly. This includes, but is not limited to electromagnetic signal.  


> Cells also recognize other communications, other languages from the environment, not just the electromagnetic. These include such things as pressure and magnetic, chemical, and temperature fluctuations. And this sensitivity to subtle communications in the electromagnetic spectrum is not limited to cells. Even enzymes and molecules can recognize and process different electromagnetic frequencies and amplitudes. These kinds of oscillations, or wave signals, make up one of the primary languages used by all self-organized systems.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 67)

  
....  

#### All self-organized systems (organisms) express an unique electromagnetic frequency 

All self-organized systems (organism) express an unique electromagnetic frequency, a field, as a consequence of the bioelectric functioning of its cellular system. This field is in contact with the field of others, and vice versa, which is part of how this self-organize system is able to be in its dynamic dance of equilibrium with the perturbations introduced by external factors.

> All selforganized systems have an electromagnetic identity, a field of force surrounds them, which comes from this constant electromagnetic activity. And these fields of force are always coming into contact with each other.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 68)

#### All self-organized systems (organisms) both communicate and self-organize through electric frequency

  
For example, the electric fields that support developing embryos to produce organs and produce them in the correct place within the larger biological system that will become the body.  
  

> In fact, organisms at all levels of complexity generate and use electric fields in their development, their functioning, and their responses to external perturbations.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 68)


The same process is underway in the healing of injury. The wound disrupts the normal electric functioning of the area, and this creates another kind of field which called other cells from the system to come in and repair. 

> so, for example, in tissue organization. Electric fields produced by embryos are used to actually direct the placement and differentiation of the various cells that will become organs, the skeletal system, and so on. M—(Buhner, 2004, p. 68)


It is also a means by which organisms communicate with each other.

> While these electrical signals are used by all organisms to promote health and functioning, they are also exchanged between organisms throughout the living world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 69)


#### Fish can detect extremely weak electric signals in order to hunt the fish that they eat

Fish can detect extremely weak electric signals in order to hunt the fish that they eat. They do this because their body acts as a kind of signal array to amplify weak signals in what is otherwise a cacophony of noise.

> Fish, for example, can detect extremely weak electric signals in order to hunt the fish that they eat as food.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 73)
...
> To gain an idea of just how sensitive to weak electrical signals these kinds of fish are, if you connected wires to each end of a 1 1/2 volt flashlight battery and placed the other ends of the wires two thousand miles apart in the ocean, sharks and rays would be able to detect the electric field that is produced. They can, in fact, perceive a change in an electrical field equivalent to one-millionth of a volt. Some fish have been found to be sensitive to fields as tiny as 25 billionths of a volt. This sensitivity is nearly refined enough for the fish to count individual electrons as they touch the surface of its skin.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 74)
...  
> and salt water is a very good conductor of electrical signals—(Buhner, 2004, p. 74)



#### Organs of the body can act like a signal array to amplify weak signals, like fish 

Such as a heart, a liver, of the skin cells of a fish that function like a signal array that can detect the electric field of its prey.

> Cells, operating individually at their own frequencies, can synchronize or entrain as they move into proximity with other cells. They, like molecules, can self-organize, forming one macroscopic, ordered whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Such cellular groups tightly couple together and form aggregates that display long-range coherence or self-organization. They also develop emergent behaviors that are unique to the whole.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 73)




....  

#### All living organisms give of an electric frequency, but their relative frequency is weak in comparison to the sheer amount of frequency in the general radiation of any given moment 


All living organisms both give of an electric signals and have cellular organization evolved to detect the signals of others

> All living organisms in the world, and there are trillions of them, are giving off electric energy; the billions of coupled cells within any organism trying to detect weak electrical signals also give off a lot of electrical energy—(Buhner, 2004, p. 75)
> 

The massive amount of electromagnetic signal being expressed by all living organisms, all cells, all thing on Earth, produces a kind mass of noise that is significant enough that the relative frequency of any given thing is extremely weak.

> To an electrical detection system, all of this background electric energy is “noise,”—electrical emissions that are not related to the signal they would like to detect.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 75)

  
....  

#### Organisms develop shields to protect their internal electric fields from external interference

an organism develops to protect its internal fields needed to allow from effective self-organization and function of its various cellular functions from the general radiation of the external world.

> biological tissues strongly shield electric fields—(Buhner, 2004, p. 75)

  
....  

#### Despite shielding, organisms can detect weak signals through amplification of said signal by way of Stochastic resonance

Despite this shielding from electrical energy and the relatively weak signal of any particular thing, organisms can still detect specifics, which happens at a cellular level. Not explicitly through detection alone, but through detection coupled with the capacity to oscillate in harmony with the detected signal in such as way as to amplify it enough so to decode it as meaningful signal to that organism. This is amplification is done through stochastic resonance.
  
e.g. A shark detecting and decoding the electromagnetic frequency of a particular fish into the recognition of it as prey.

> The combination of this shielding and all the background electrical noise seemed to reductionistic thinking to be an insurmountable barrier to an organism’s ability to detect weak electric fields. But living organisms can and do extract information from extremely weak incoming electrical signals against this background of natural noisy electrical processes. They are able to take an electrical pulse, just as our radios and televisions do, and turn it into usable information, just as our radios produce sounds and our televisions pictures.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 75)

  
Stochastic resonance is the ability to use the frequencies present in the background noise that are the same as that of the signal being detected in order to amplify that signal though that signal and the matching noise frequency resonating in harmony together to increase its amplitude.  
  
(like when you have many single voices speaking at the same time to carry a message much louder than one voice speaking)  
  
Organisms use this along with producing a resonant frequency in their cells to amplify the otherwise weak signal it is attempting to detect.

> Because the information that they can detect in such pulses may have a strong bearing on their ability to maintain their dynamic equilibrium and thus their self-organized state of being, it is essential that living organisms be able to detect perturbations at the lowest level possible. And they have developed ways to do so, at the mathematically calculable limits of such detection. One such method is stochastic resonance.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 76)
...  
> Some of this background noise will naturally oscillate at the same frequency as the weak signal the organism wants to detect.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 77)
...
> All organisms, in fact, possess mechanisms to “fine tune” their internal electromagnetic dial in order to enhance the signals they receive. As the signal is fine tuned, it gets stronger , and more and more background noise entrains to the signal, making it stronger still. This process is so powerful that a weak signal’s strength can be increased ten thousand times.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 77)

All organisms can do this in one way or another because it has been evolutionarily necessary for them to; because the broadband electromagnetic environment is the existence they (all of life as we know it) have evolved within.

> The ability of living organisms to utilize background noise to enhance signal reception is inherent in these self-organized and emergent systems’ tremendous sensitivity to external perturbations.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 77)
...  
> They have learned to use them automatically, just as our lungs automatically separate out oxygen from the atmosphere and our bodies use it for functioning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 77)

  
....  

#### Signal detection and amplification for decoding information and communication is magnetic as well as electric

A similar action is underway with not only electric frequency, but magnetic as well. These magnetic fields also influence biological functioning, as well as are expressed by biological functioning into the environment.

> Cells and living organisms not only perceive, decode, and respond to extremely weak electrical signals, they perceive, decode, and respond to magnetic signals. And magnetic fields contain information, just as electric signals do.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 78)
...  
> And these tiny magnetic signals, just like electric signals, can be amplified.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 78)

For example, salmon, birds, and honeybees.

> This capacity to interpret and respond to information encoded within magnetic fields is built into all biological systems and is an evolutionarily intended ability—(Buhner, 2004, p. 78)

  
....  

#### Human detection of magnetic frequency through hippocampal magnetite

Humans produce magnetite in their bodies, and is located in the hippocampus, thus the hippocampus is very sensitive to magnetic fluctuations.  
  
Interesting to consider the hippocampus as also being a primary brain system related to orientation in physical space, and spatial memory. (eg. [[@birdHippocampusMemoryInsights2008|The hippocampus and memory]])

> Closer examination of magnetic-sensitive birds, bees, and fish has revealed that they all contain magnetite in their bodies. Magnetite is an ore that is very sensitive to magnetic fields. (Lodestone is a form of magnetite used to make the earliest compass needles. Lodestone, unlike magnetite, is polarized. One side of it is pulled toward the magnetic north pole.) It turns out that the presence of magnetite in living organisms is pervasive, from bacteria to mammals. Magnetite is, in fact, made by living organisms inside their bodies, not gathered in from the environment. It is under precise biological control. Though most people do not know it, human beings have magnetite in their bodies, as well. It is located in the hippocampus and that organ is very sensitive to fluctuations in magnetic fields.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 79)

  
....  

#### The hippocampus has a role in the "extraction of meaning" and creating a "map of meaning"

He proposes that the hippocampus plays are role in the extraction of meaning from the signals present in our environment. This might line up with the role of the hippocampus in orienting us through stitching elements of the environment together with memory to map oneself within that environment. (I believe this is related to the the [[@birdHippocampusMemoryInsights2008|hippocampus and spatial processing]])

> The hippocampus is a very important organ for human beings. It is highly involved in interpreting spatial relationships, memory, and the extraction of meaning from the vast sea of signals within which we live. It is also closely attuned to the healthy functioning of the heart.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 79)

Thus, if the hippocampus is not functioning properly, then one cannot perceive nor navigate meaning.

> The meanings encoded in language (or in any communication, such as facial expression) cannot be decoded if the hippocampus is malfunctioning. The hippocampus decodes and integrates sensory information to provide not a directional map, but a map of experience, a map of the meanings through which we travel.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 80)
  
....  

#### The hippocampus as a meaning hub

Buhner proposes that the hippocampus is the central hub for sensory signals to be decoded for meaning and then transferred to other parts of the brain for response and/or and/or processing and/or consolidation. That it 


> But the most interesting thing about the hippocampus is how it works with meaning. All the sensory systems of our bodies converge in the hippocampus; all the sensory impulses we receive flow to it. And all these sensory impulses contain a great deal of information. The hippocampus deciphers the meanings in the sensory impulses we receive and acts as a central transfer point for many different sites in the neocortex that, together, represent or hold memories. In other words, the hippocampus extracts patterns encoded within sensory flows and sends these decoded patterns to other portions of the brain for storage as memories and for further processing.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 80)

  
....  

#### Immersion in enriched environments stimulate greater hippocampal and CNS benefits than simple environments


> Enriched environments stimulate the formation of many more neurons than simple environments do. We are made to be in the wild nonlinearity of the world, and this immersion is needed for the hippocampus and our central nervous system to be healthy.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 81)

  

....  
#### It is so complex that there is no way to understand the web of communications with the linear mind, but we can learn to engage
  
Ultimately, we cannot truly grok the entirely of this communication, but what we can do is, with intention, attention, and effort, learn to attune ourselves to specific channels of such that communication with that particular channel can develop over time, through the development of a language for with, through the conduit-container-crucible function of our relationship with it.

> In short, there is an extremely sophisticated electric and magnetic communication that is going on all the time among trillions and trillions of organisms. A web of communications that is so complex and detailed that there is no way to understand it with the linear, analytical mind.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 82)


We can, however, develop the ability to enter into and navigate that web of communication such that we can understand our engagements with it enough to respond and build relationship with that/those/who we are in communication with. 

> We, as human beings, are also of this Earth and possess, as all living organisms do, the ability, however atrophied, to understand these communications and respond in turn.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 82)

  
....  

### SECTION TWO --  THE HEART—(Buhner, 2004, p. 83)

#### The heart is a kind of brain  
  
The heart is not just a pump, but has many other functions and capacities, such as a producing hormones, as a genetic of electromagnetic frequencies, and as an essential aspect of the central nervous system. It’s role in the body works something like a central communication hub for psychological function.  
  
In this way, the heart plays a vital role in many systems in the body that directly and indirectly affect cognitive function and thus consciousness.

> The heart processes and generates complex patterns of multiple physiological events: it sends hormonal, neurohormonal, electric, magnetic, and chemical messages, as well as information about temperature and pressure, to the brain and throughout the body. All of these have deep impacts not only on our physiological functioning and health, but also on how and how well we think and feel—in fact, on our consciousness.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 86)

...
#### The Heart-Brain = "the intracardiac nervous system"

>[! Tip]
>In modern scientific lingo, this heart-brain is called the intracardiac nervous system

  
....  

#### The does not pump blood, but synchronizes the flow of blood through a pumping action through measuring blood pressure

He is exploring the heart from a physicalist perspective here, as "the pumping heart".  
  
In this he was speaking to blood pressure, presenting that a read blood pressure metric is the x/y, with x being the systolic, the measure of pressure when the heart is pumping; and diastolic, the pressure of the system at rest.  
  
The pressure if made not just through the hearts function, but also by the resistance in the blood vessels. So that pressure can go up or down depending on the interactions between these two aspects of the system (power of hearts pump action and the resistance or constriction of the blood vessels).  
  
This pressure is measured and the metrics and distributed by pressure detecting cells called mechano or baroreceptors. The information of these changes in pressure, which vary beat to beat, go out to various systems in the body alter as a response.

> blood pressure is created by the tension between the pressure of the heart’s constriction and the total peripheral resistance to that constriction. Blood pressure, on a strictly mechanical level, changes when there is a fluctuation in either cardiac output or peripheral resistance, or both. The level of pressure in the cardiovascular system is detected by the body’s sensitive pressure detectors—called mechano—or baro receptors—that are scattered up and down the arterial tree.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 87)

  
However, the peripheral resistance that contributes to that blood pressure (what we earlier included vascular constriction as an element) is also influenced by the organs of the body.  
  
These organs squeeze back against the pressure waves of the hearts pumping and create a reverse pressure wave. These reverse waves are what send blood back to the heart.

> But the peripheral resistance in the system changes from moment to moment, just as the heart’s pumping pressure does. These peripheral resistance alterations come not only from the degree of constriction in the vessels, but also from the organs that receive the blood. Organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines, in fact, squeeze back, or constrict (just as the vessels do), in response to the pressure waves generated by the heart—(Buhner, 2004, p. 87)


These reverse pressure waves, like the pumping of the heat, are rhythmic oscillations that are in constant variation in response to the system.  
  
The baroreceptors track this too, and that information goes back to the heart. The whole system is in a feedback loop that regulates blood pressure in the body and alters moment to moment.

> Like the heart, the organs and vessels are constantly analyzing information from their environment and altering their functioning, and informational communications, in response. They signal back to the heart by increasing and relaxing resistance in the system.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 88)
...  
> The baroreceptors note all these minute alterations in pressure and send them to the brain, which then alters its activity . These alterations are also fed back to the heart, which then adjusts its functioning, changing the beating, timing, and strength of heart contractions. It is an extremely elegant feedback loop—a living dialogue—that is used to modify the mechanical beating of the heart from millisecond to millisecond.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 88)

  
....  

#### The heart, however, as a mechanical pump is an incomplete model -- mechanical pump = linear, but organisms are non-linear

However, this mechanical pumping heart is only one way to perceive the heart and it's function, and it is a perception that requires it to function like a machine (e.g. a steam engine) which lacks the recognition of the non-linear dynamic of the heart as both an organ and a central aspect of a non-linear system of the organism.

> As with all complex phenomena , the complete range of factors affecting heart rate cannot, and will never, be fully identified or measured. For all nonlinear systems, this irregularity makes them more highly adaptable and robust. This plasticity allows the heart, like all nonlinear systems, to cope with the changing demands of an unpredictable and shifting environment. The heart is actually a highly refined nonlinear system and, like all such systems, responds unpredictably to stimuli.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 89)

  
....  

### THE NONPUMPING HEART—(Buhner, 2004, p. 89)

  
#### The heart as a mechanical pump is a model that emerged from the era of steam engines

The heart as a mechanical pump is a model that emerged from the era of steam engines. It is physicalist and, at least, incomplete.

> The traditional view of the heart as a pump was engineered out of the nineteenth-century fascination with steam engines. It is merely a mechanical model of the heart and its function that reflects the reductionistic, linear thinking of Euclid and Newton. In that model, the steam engine (or heart) is the worker that provides motive force; the water (or blood) is simply a passive, nonliving substance that is forced around the system by the pump’s activity . But deeper contemplation shows, and did even in the nineteenth century, that the heart, as powerful as it is, is not really the pump it is supposed to be—(Buhner, 2004, p. 89)

  
....  

#### The heart does not create the pressure by pumping, the pressure is created by the blood stream 

Due to the actual pressure needed to move blood through the body being far greater than what the heart can produce.  
  
The heart does not create the pressure by pumping, the pressure is created by the blood stream itself by the creation and maintenance of a kind of vacuum within the heart, similar to the centre of a tornado. Composed of three streams, spiralling through the ventricles of the heart and arteries.

> The heart is, in reality, not the pump of the circulatory system, but plays a much more subtle and elegant role, for the heart does not pump the blood. The blood, counterintuitively, moves of its own accord.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 90)
...  
> Blood flow through embryo vessels is instead composed of two streams. And these two streams spiral around one another in the direction of flow. Nor do these streams flow at a regular rate.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 90)
...  
> At the center of these spiraling streams there is . . . nothing, a vacuum. In fact, blood flow through living vessels is much more like a tornado than anything else: It is a vortex circling around a vacuum center. At all times, up to one-third of the space occupied by the blood stream is a void, a vacuum. Such a vacuum is necessary for producing a vortex.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 90)
...  
> The pressure that is measured as blood pressure does not come from the heart’s pumping pressure, but instead is a natural result of the movement of the spiraling, vacuum-centered blood itself.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 90)
...  
> Blood, at least in the left ventricle, is composed of not two but three streams. Both the heart and arteries move spirally, actually twist, as they work, to enhance this spiral motion of the blood. The blood vessels and heart also show a series of spiral folds on their inner surfaces. This kind of spiraling in the heart and vessel tissues enhances the flow. Liquids move faster and much more easily when they travel in a spiral motion.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 91)

  
....  
#### The vacuum spiral of blood flow can only be seen in living organisms

This can only be seen in living bodies, as once dead the blood and blood vessel are not longer animate in such  a way to work together to create these spiralling streams.

> They are only present in living tissue. The blood and vessels work together to make these spirals, whose shape changes from moment to moment in concert with the living flow of the blood.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 91)


....
#### Each of the aspects of blood spiral differently
Each of the aspects of blood spiral differently, RBC are heavier, and platelets lights. The relates of spin of these different aspects create different frequencies due to these differing rates of spin.

> Blood is composed of various parts, and these parts orient themselves differently in the vortex of the bloodstream.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 91)
 
###### Red blood cells are flat due to the centrifugal force of their spin

Further, RBC are also spinning and their flattened shape is a result of the  acting on it as a result. That shape is also in constant flux.

> The red blood cells themselves not only spin around the vortex, they also spin along their own axes of rotation. They spin very fast on their individual axes and bulge in response, developing more mass at the outside of the cell from the centrifugal force of their spin. They are, in fact, smaller spinning cells within a larger spinning vortex—(Buhner, 2004, p. 92)

  
....  

#### The heart monitors the frequencies given off by the spin and pressure waves of various organ systems, adjusting it's own beat to maintain harmony

All of these different functions of pressure, waves, squeezing (or organs and muscles), spin, spiral, etc all give off a frequency. The heart plays a central role of monitoring all of this and adapting its function to serve harmony in the whole system, to serve to appropriate flow of blood through the body.

> The heart, inserted into this flowing system, serves an auxiliary function. It couples together with the circulatory system and phase-locks its own pulsating, spiraling, pumping action with the action already occurring in the blood. This stabilizes and regulates the flow. The heart constantly monitors the blood through sensitive receptors embedded throughout the heart and arterial tree, and alters its functioning constantly to make subtle, second-to-second shifts in the flow of blood.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 92)

#### This exchange between organ systems and the heart amounts to inter-organism communication, a dialogue.

All this information exchange and adaptation to each other between the various systems of the blood, heart, organs, muscles, vessels, arteries, etc are, essentially communication, A dialogue.

> All of this is, in fact, a dialogue.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 92)

  
....  

### THE HEART AS ENDOCRINE GLAND—(Buhner, 2004, p. 93)

  

#### The heart is also an organ of hormone production and delivery

Early perception of the endocrine system attributed only certain organs to hormone production, like the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. However, it has been shown that every organ in the body produces hormones. And the heart is one of the major ones.  
  
It not only produces hormones, but delivers them throughout the body.

> it turns out that every organ in the body produces hormones, molecular substances that significantly alter physical functioning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 93)

  
....  

#### There are 5 major hormones produced by the heart

There are 5 major hormones produced by the heart, ANF, BNF, CNP, HPVD, CGRP.  
  
They each have important roles to play in the heart, but also serve important and direct functions beyond the heart.

> first two hormones researchers noticed were atrial naturetic peptide or factor (ANP or ANF) and brain naturetic peptide or factor (BNP or BNF). ANF is produced in the atria of the heart, BNF is produced in the ventricles. The latest discoveries are called C-type naturetic peptide (CNP), heart-produced vessel dilator (HPVD), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Research has recently shown that HPVD strongly inhibits pancreatic cancer cells.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 93)

#### The heart helps protect the brain through sending BNF during times of stress

e.g. BNF, Brain natriuretic factor, which is produced in periods of stress and (among other functions) has direct effect on the brain to release beta-amyloid precursor protein, which works to protect the brain, especially the hippocampus.

> While BNF has a number of effects, when a person is under stress, BNF activates a specific pathway in the neuronal cells of the brain and the heart that causes the secretion of a unique protein—beta-amyloid precursor protein. This protein protects both brain and heart neurons from stressors (such as toxic levels of glutamate), especially in the hippocampus.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 94)

  
#### ANF helps regulate organ systems

ANF, atrial natriuretic factor, plays an important role in many other organs and systems of the body, working as a kind of regulating signal.  
  
It's levels are also indicators or problems as it presence alters as the heart adapts to the system and system input and output (which can be supported or degraded based on various lifestyle factors)

> The hormone travels through the bloodstream to targets throughout the body, including vascular tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, the kidneys, adrenal glands, immune system, brain, posterior pituitary gland, pineal gland (which secretes melatonin), hypothalamus, lung, liver, ciliary body (which secrets the lymphlike aqueous humor of the eye), and small intestine. ANF also plays a role in regulating the hormonal pathways that stimulate the function and development of male and female reproductive organs.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 94)

  
....  

#### Dopamine is Produced by the heart (⚠️)

>[! warning] Dopamine is not produced by the heart
>
>This is not correct as far as my attempt to verify it suggests. It is produced outside the brain, but dopamine cannot cross the BBB so it plays other functions.  
  >
>There is no seeming evidence that any of it is produced by the heart directly. There are dopamine receptors on the heart, and the cardiovascular system is effects by dopamine. So an indirect effect is clearly possible  
  >
>But, it would seem that all direct brain levels of dopamine are the result of dopamine produced within the brain.
>
>> Dopamine is created in the heart from the dietary precursor L-dopa (or its precursors, tyrosine and phenylalanine), and is an essential chemical enabling the transfer of information from neuron to neuron.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 96)

  
....  

### THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM HEART—(Buhner, 2004, p. 97)

  
....  

#### The heart has neural cells that function like a brain and nervous system within the heart itself

The brain possesses neural cells that collectively operate like a kind of brain within the heart, which too has its own nervous system, which modern science is now calling the intracardiac nervous system.  
  
These nerve cells are directly link to various centre in the brain, such as amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex.

> The heart possesses its own nervous system and, in essence, is a specialized brain that processes specific types of information.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 97)

  
....  
#### The heart stores memories that affect consciousness and behaviour

(this has been validated by recent research, [[@hashimHeartMemoryFeelings2022]])

> The heart also has its own memory . People who receive transplanted hearts often take on behaviors common to the person to whom the heart originally belonged—(Buhner, 2004, p. 97)
...  
> These memories affect consciousness and behavior, how we perceive the world. They most often have to do with specific emotional experiences and the meanings embedded within them. The more intense the emotional experience, the more likely it will be stored by the heart as memory.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 98)

  
....


#### The pulse of the heart contains information that is sent to the brain and felt as emotions, influencing perception

His proposal is here seems to be that the the pulse of the heart contains information that is sent to the brain—impacted by the heart as central hub to communication/"dialogue" from and between all the various function of the body and organ system, produced and processed within the intracardiac nervous system— can directly translate into felt emotions, which then influenced behaviour via its influence on the CNS.  
  
This amounts to a kind of heart-brain dialogue playing a central role in perception and behaviour.

> information embedded within cardiac outputs directly reaches many of the subcortical areas of the brain involved in emotional processing. The kinds of information that the heart sends significantly shifts functioning of the amygdala   thus affecting emotions   and other subcortical centers of the brain.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 98)

  
Further, he proposes that the heart is the first line of perception, with the brain secondary, together working in neural dialogue to give rise to perception and response.

> Single neurons in the brain alter their behavior in response to the signals received from each heartbeat. In response to cardiac input, complexes of neurons in the brain change their grouping and firing patterns. They alter their behavior in order to embed the information received through cardiac function and send it into the central nervous system. The information embedded within cardiac pulses alters central nervous function in behaviorally significant ways.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 98)
> ...
> What this means is that our experience of the world is routed first through our heart, which “thinks” about the experience and then sends the data to the brain for further processing—(Buhner, 2004, p. 99)
...  
> The heart routinely engages in a neural dialogue with the brain and, in essence, the two decide together what actions to take.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 99)

  
....  
#### Part of the hearts function is related to reception and production of electromagnetic fields, exampled in pacemaker cells

Part of the hearts function is related to reception and production of electromagnetic fields.  
  
A key indicator of this are pacemaker cells, which are a self-organized group of cells that entrain to each other and oscillate in frequency patterns that inform the regular beating of the heart.

> When the organizing subunits that are destined to become the heart’s pacemaker cells reach a certain level of complexity during embryonic development, they self-organize. At that point, the first pacemaker cells begin beating, displaying an emergent oscillatory behavior.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 99)

  
This is a non-linear system, and and requires all the cells working together to produce this behaviour. A singular pacemaker cell will fibrillate until it dies, but next to another cell (which is not fibrillating) will entrain and pulse together coherently.

> As with all nonlinear systems, the coupling of millions and millions of heart cells modifies their behavior and produces new behavior and potentials that cannot be predicted from the study of the individual cells in isolation.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 100)
...  
> A fibrillating cell, placed next to a non-fibrillating pacemaker cell, will stop fibrillating and entrain, or begin to beat in unison with the healthy cell.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 100)

......
Furthermore, they don't actually need to be touching because the entrainment is happening through the electric field they produce.

> The reason that these cells do not need to touch is that they are producing an electric field as they beat, as all biological oscillators do.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 100)

.....
The main groups of pacemakers cells are in the upper atria (left and right) and such time the heart pulses produce an electric pulse that conducts through various tissues in the body.  


> The two most powerful groupings of heart pacemaker cells are in the upper right and left atria, the portions of the heart that start the contractions that force blood into the ventricles—(Buhner, 2004, p. 100)
> ...
> These regular muscle contractions of the heart generate volume currents —electrical pulses—in the ionic, electrically conductive tissues of the body.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 101)

 ..... 
This electric pulse is what is measures in an electrocardiogram (ECG).

> It is this pattern of electrical activity that is measured when an electrocardiogram (ECG) is taken by placing electrodes on the body.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 101)


....
#### The Heart also produces a (measurable) Magnetic field through blood flow

It is not just electric, though, as the heart also produces a magnetic field, collectively it producing an electromagnetic field. (also measurable)

> But the heart also generates magnetic fields (which is why it is often referred to as electromagnetic, instead of just electric) and those magnetic fields can be measured as well, with a magneto cardiogram.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 101)

This magnetic field is created by the presence of ions blood generating that field through their dynamics within the vortices of blood flow, in the heart, in blood vessel, and even the spinning of the blood cells together as they flow throughout the body.  
  
In this way, the blood not only carried various nutrients, but also electromagnetic signals throughout the body.

> he heart’s electric and magnetic fields are created not only by the vortex of the blood in the heart, but also by the vortex of the blood in the vessels and the spinning motion of the blood cells themselves as they travel through the vessels. Just as the blood carries chemicals and cells, it also carries electromagnetic signals. These, like the other blood components, travel to all parts of the body, reaching every cell.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 101)

  
....

#### All organ systems produce an electromagnetic field, but the heart is the strongest, extending beyond the body

Each of the various organ system in the body produce their own electromagnetic field, but the heart produced the strongest. A strong broadband field.  

> The heart, in fact, produces a tremendously powerful, broadband electromagnetic field as it beats.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 102)

  
That field extends out beyond the body in a torus shape, that is in constant flux as the non-linear system that it is.

> But the magnetic field produced by the heart is not located on a flat piece of paper. It extends around the body in a torus, a fractal, sort-of-spherical shape that continually flows through space.   Measured with magnetic field meters, the electromagnetic field that the heart produces is some five thousand times more powerful than that created by the brain. While strongest at the body’s surface, it extends out further than human measuring devices can detect. —(Buhner, 2004, p. 102)
...  
> The electromagnetic field of the heart, however, is not a neatly symmetrical field of similar arcs.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 102)

  
....  

#### All organisms, and even the Earth as a whole, produce an electromagnetic field around them 

Interestingly, it is not only the human heart that produces an electromagnetic field but all organisms, and even the planet as a whole (wherein the planet's magnetic field is of similar shape to that of the one produced by the heart).

> The Earth’s magnetic field is a very similar torus (or pattern) to what hearts (and magnets) emit.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 102)
...  
> All living organisms possess just such a torus, including plants.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 103)

  
....  

#### The electromagnetic field created by the heart is a like a field of communication within and beyond the body

The electromagnetic field created by the heart is a like a field of communication within and beyond the body, wherein their is information encoded within that irregularities of that pulse and its interaction with the various systems of the body, decoded by those systems and the heart as a part of that dialogue.  
  
> The whole body is cradled within the electromagnetic field generated by the heart. The information embedded within that field is communicated to the external world through electromagnetic waves reaching out from the body. It is communicated within the body through the bloodstream, which conducts electromagnetic impulses throughout the body.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 103)

But, being that this field extends beyond the body, it is also communicating to the outside world as well.

> The heart sends out informational messages on multiple frequencies, all the millions of elements of the body receive them and respond—and, within milliseconds of time, the heart’s beating patterns alter in response. The electromagnetic pulsations of our hearts are more properly part of an ongoing dialogue, a communication, whose function is to help maintain the dynamic equilibrium of the self-organized systems we know as ourselves.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 103)

  
....  

#### The frequencies of the electromagnetic field of the heart operate as a kind of language

Given that the various processes of the body that are involved with and reliant on this electromagnetic activity, centrally cadenced by the heart, it is as though the this (these) field(s) operate as kind of language, facilitating communication within the body, but also outwards to the world.

> The distinct patterns of neurological, biochemical, biophysical, and electromagnetic activity generated by minute and precise alterations in heart activity function as a language that encodes information and communicates it from the heart to the body and to the world outside the body. All of these patterns are, in fact, the mediums through which the heart maintains its dynamic equilibrium.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 103)

Not only outwards, though, as our bodies are not isolated and entirely self-contained entities, but are in constant dynamic with the outside world. This not only through the material factors we might immediately identify, but also through our field's interaction with the various fields produced by electromagnetic pulses of other organisms and even whole ecologies.  
  
....  


#### The heart is an organ of perception

The heart is extremely sensitive to things that might disrupt its function and is not highly responsive to any "perturbations" of that function such that it can adapt as needed (supporting and in dialogue the other organs and brain in the process).  

As an organ sensitive and response to electromagnetic frequencies the heart responds to this, too. That responses amounts to not only transmitting internal function to the outside world, but translating outside world to internal function.  
  
I.e. the heart is an organ of perception.

> ts electromagnetic field allows it to touch the dynamic, electromagnetic fields created by other living organisms and to exchange energy. Like all nonlinear systems that display self-organization and emergent behaviors, the heart is supremely sensitive to external perturbations that may affect its dynamic equilibrium. The heart not only transmits field pulses of electromagnetic energy, it also receives them, like a radio in a car. And like a radio, it is able to decode the information embedded within the electromagnetic fields it senses. It is, in fact, an organ of perception.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 104)

#### The heart is an organ of communication through electromagnetic frequency
  
When heart's EM field (or any organism) gets close to the field of another organism, the two field exchange information in the form of perturbations in the oscillations of their frequencies as occasioned by their interactions with each other causing a need to calibrate to maintain their internal dynamic equilibrium.

> When the heart’s electromagnetic field and any other organism’s electromagnetic field   whether it has a “heart” or not   are in close proximity , the fields entrain or synchronize, and there is an extremely rapid and complex interchange of information. As the two fields harmonize with one another , shifts occur in each electromagnetic field, producing significant alterations in the physiological functioning of each organism.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 106)
...  
> The information in the encountered electromagnetic field is a perturbation of each organism’s dynamic nonequilbrium and, like the clown on the unicycle, an alteration of internal dynamics is needed in order for them to keep equilibrium.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 106)

....  
When the fields between these organisms synchronizes, an emergent third comes into existence that amounts to the two fields becoming one.

> The perturbations that occur when another electromagnetic field is encountered alter each organism’ s coupling dynamics, producing new, cooperative, dynamic states. In addition, as the two fields come together and synchronize, the process produces a combination field, in effect, two fields in one. And these two fields are, like all nonlinear oscillators, in harmony.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 106)

  
....  
The heart complex and non-linear EM spectrum is a result of the dynamic equilibrium being maintained between as the various elements of the body physiology in communion and communication with each other and the brain, through the heart, expressed through "multiple waves and frequencies with each beat."  
  
There is a gestalt of information encoded in all this, in each and any given moment, that goes out from the heart to both the body's internal environment and the external environment. And this gestalt changes according to the information the heart receives from the body and from the outside world.

> any one moment in time there is an informational gestalt, a gesture of communication, going out from the heart to both the external and internal environments in which it lives. And this particular gestalt changes from moment to moment, depending on the information the heart receives from those environments.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 107)

  
....
Effectively, the heart is an organ with a highly complex system of communication with both the various aspects of our own physiology and with external organisms, through electromagnetic means (as well as the biological cascade that correlated with what the information within each heart beat helps to co-ordinate happening).

> The heart is extremely complex, and the energy fields it creates, emits, and uses in communicating with other energy systems (the rest of the body or other organisms) are extremely complex as well.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 107)

  
....  
These information gestalts, or energetic expressions, are essential encoded packages of meaning that have effects on external organisms.

> All of these energetic expressions encode meaning, and all have effects on external organisms.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 107)

  
....  

#### The heart as an organ that entrains-attunes to external organisms

The heart as an organ that entrains to external organisms is exampled in the interpersonal neurobiology and early life attunement to between infant and mother, in infancy and in utero. e.g. [[We organize our sense of self around mother's attunement (or lack there of)]]

> The merging and entrainment of our hearts with other electromagnetic fields is extremely natural to us; it is one of our earliest experiences. For this entrainment first occurs before birth.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 108)

....
Part how how that attunement happens is through being within the electromagnetic field of the mother/caregiver, and through that field there is a communication that has impacts on the infant that not only includes the physical training of the nervous system through exo-regulation, but even feelings/perception encoded into the infant's psyche through the mother' perception of them, as conveyed (at least in part) by the EM field that perception is correlated with.

> We are immersed in our mothers’ electromagnetic fields while in their wombs, and electroencephalogram and electromagnetogram readings have shown that the fields of the two, mother and infant in utero, naturally synchronize or entrain.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 108)
> ...
> And the mother’s electromagnetic field encodes large amounts of complex information that affect the child far beyond mere mechanical dynamics.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 108)

  
....  
It is a part of the development of the human heart to be sensitive to external frequency, and this carries over into adult life.  

This expresses as an openness to the perturbations in our own field when we come into contact with the field of another organism, wherein that alteration in our field contains information that (unique to humans) manifests subjectively as emotions, as meanings.  
  
The information we can receive in EM communication with other organisms is experiences as alterations in our emotional experience. Those emotions are perceptual manifestations of particular aspects of EM frequencies, similar to how what we perceive as colour is the perceptual manifestation of particular aspects of EM frequencies.

> Because the human heart is born into a situation in which its first functionings are intimately involved with information coming from another electromagnetic field, it continues throughout its life to be sensitive to the information in electromagnetic fields.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 108)
...  
> Whenever the heart comes across other biological oscillators and their electromagnetic fields, and as its field is perturbed by the other fields at their first touch, the heart experiences an alteration in its electromagnetic spectrum. The way the electromagnetic field is altered conveys information. If the two fields synchronize, even more information is conveyed. The way these radiating fields of energy patterns and their perturbations are experienced by human beings is unique. They are experienced as emotions.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 108)
...  
> The electromagnetic field frequencies of the heart are experienced not as colors or tastes, but as emotions—(Buhner, 2004, p. 109)
...  
> The heart is, in fact, an extremely sensitive sensory organ whose domain is that of feelings. Emotions represent the impact of specific electromagnetic spectrum carrier waves upon us, as colors are the impact of visual carrier waves.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 109)

  
....  

#### The 10 million colours of feeling

Although basic emotions are relatively broad, their range and complexity is nearly infinite in their capacity to be blended into subtle variations.  
  
E.g. although there are only a few primary colours, there are up to 10 million variations of colours perceivable to the human eye.

> Just as the variations in electromagnetic response of the nonlinear oscillator we know as our heart approaches infinity through the fractalization of its processes, our experiences of those shifting processes allows a nearly infinite number of emotional blends.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 109)

  
....  

#### The Brain, GI, and Heart are the main three biological oscillators of the body

It is not only the heart that is a biological oscillator that constitutes to the various fields within the body.  
  
But. the three major ones are the heart, the GI, and the brain.

> The human body contains a great many biological oscillators, all hooked together in the organism we know as ourselves.   The three most powerful are the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and brain.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 109)

  
  
....  

#### The interactions between these oscillators works as a signalling and communication network for internal functioning

Together, the interactions between these oscillators works as a signalling and communication network for internal functioning.  
  
Some of the information within those communication fields and pulses are directly perceivable as emotions, as "specific emotion states". These are essentially cues as to what is happening internally that we can detect, but only if we pay attention to them as such.  
  
This relates to Chinese medicine and vitalistic herbalism, which correlates dysfunction in various organ systems as being intertwined with different emotional processes and expression.

> That our internal world expresses information to us in emotional information pulses was reflected in classical understandings that organ malfunction would be accompanied by specific emotional states.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 110)
>...
> These emotions give us informational, sensory cues about what is going on within us. 
> 
> if only we will pay attention—(Buhner, 2004, p. 109)
...
> We then experience an electromagnetic pulse of information, felt as emotions, coming from a shift in our internal functioning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 110)

  
....  

#### Our capacity to perceive and disambiguate the subtleties of emotional states and what they may signal requires a lost nuance in language 

Our capacity to perceive and disambiguate the subtleties of these emotional states and what they may signal requires a kind of nuance in our language that we have lost. Not that we have not developed it, as it did exist in older cultures, but that we have lost it due to an atrophy of the capacity from both under use and suppression by cultural conditioning.

> Unfortunately, in our time, our languaging for these internal states is extremely limited.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 110)
...  
> Ancient and indigenous cultures, focused more on the heart as an organ of perception, generally were more able to elegantly articulate these internally generated emotional states.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 110)

  
....  
Just like we are able to tune our attention to the emotional cues about our internal functioning, so too can we do can we receive cues about the external world through the same skilled emotional attention.

> If we direct our consciousness outside ourselves and pay attention to the biological oscillators we encounter there, we can also become aware of the emotions generated by our encounters with external electromagnetic fields.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 110)

  
....  
Consider this capacity an iteration of the what happens in early childhood with out attunement with Mother through their EM field, but beyond them into the recognition that we, our mothers, and all those around us also exist in the influencing field of the natural world we are surrounded by, even to the extent of the whole earth and its frequencies. Thus, we, each of us, are expressions of the ecology we were raised in and lived in as we grew attuned to it.

> We developed nestled not only in our mothers’ electromagnetic fields, but also within the larger electromagnetic field of the Earth. We are an expression of the ecosystem, the womb, the Earth, an ecological response of the planet. And this kind of information exchange is embedded deeply within our cellular memories—(Buhner, 2004, p. 111)

  
....  
#### The heart is a sensory organ detecting perturbations in its own electromagnetic field

The proposal here is that the heart is itself a sensory organ, sensing perturbations in its own EM field triggered by not only internal variables but encounters with the external world as well.

> The heart is, then, a receptor organ, receiving information not only from within, but also from the external world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 111)

  
....  
And that the sensory information that the heart is perceiving, manifesting through (the 10 million colors of) emotion has just as much capacity to alter perceptual salience, thought, and behaviour as any of our other senses.  

> The incoming sensory perceptions from the heart have the same ability to capture the attention and shift behavior as those five sensory mediums.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 111)

  
....  
#### The feelings that are experienced from the sensory perception of the heart have "meanings" encoded in them 

What is being sensed through these variations in oscillation, transmitted through the frequencies and waves of the heart beat, and manifest as emotions contain a meaning that can be "extracted" just as we can extract meaning from sights. sounds, or smells.

> The heart’s wave forms, experienced as emotions, also have embedded meaning and this meaning can be extracted from the emotional flow just as meaning is extracted from visual and auditory flow.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 112)

  
....  
This is a natural human capacity that some of us still have it, some of us don't.  
  
However, it is something we have always had, but most of us have lost access to/familiarity with due to under-use and suppression by way of cultural conditioning.

> Some people remain highly attuned to its perceptions , just as others do not. P—(Buhner, 2004, p. 112)

  
....  
The heart understood as related to emotion—and even who are are and how we are in the world—has been well understood for a long time, and even prevails in modern English even as the much of the modern Western world's paradigm as been siloed into a mechanist manner of perceiving the heart (as just a pump, for example).

> t the heart is intimately concerned with emotions, with who we are and how we experience and are experienced by the life outside us, has been known throughout history to all the world’s cultures.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 112)

  
....  

#### How appreciative attention to external elements can slow the heart and increase sensory awareness 

There is a direct cardiac effect to choosing to direct attention externally and then appreciate (in the broad sense of the term) the feelings that arise as a consequence of that externalized attention.  
  
That effect is to slow the heart down, shifting both physiology and awareness (information processing) to a more parasympathetic state as well as a more more open perceptual gate, broadly.  

> Researchers John and Beatrice Lacy comment, “The intention to note and detect external stimuli results in slowing of the heart. [This can be called the] bradycardia of attention.”—(Buhner, 2004, p. 114)
...  
> This shift in the focus of awareness, from thinking to external sensory perception, significantly modifies and slows the duration of the cardiac cycle, producing a transformational cascade that affects all physiological and cognitive functioning. Simple attention to these external stimuli is sufficient.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 114)

  
....  
This change in the heart-brain neural dialogue results in the enhancement of sensory perceptions

> The immediate alteration in heart function that occurs with this shift in attention sends specific messages to the sensory-detecting areas of the brain and acts to facilitate—to enhance—these sensory perceptions.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 114)

  
....    
(this happens regardless of whether one finds that which they are attending too pleasant.)

> The shift in cardiac function that occurs when one views external visual stimuli does not depend on the pleasantness or unpleasantness of what is viewed, but rather on its complexity, potency , one’s personal evaluation of its nature, and its activity .—(Buhner, 2004, p. 115)

  
....  
Interestingly, there is an opposite effect when attention is shifted to mental activities, such as conceptual thoughts, attempts to remember or retrieve symbolic information, or even attempts to verbalize.  

> Mental activities cause an almost immediate cessation of these physiological dynamics—(Buhner, 2004, p. 115)
...  
> linear thinking breaks state—(Buhner, 2004, p. 115)

  
....  

#### The heart-brain state Coherence

The state this kind of attention creates is something some researchers call Coherence.  
  
Coherence is a state wherein attention (consciousness) is shifted to focusing on "feeling" either the heart itself or external sensory cues and the feelings they bring up.

> This shift in information processing and heart function initiates the beginning of what researcher Rollin McCraty calls a state of coherence. “It is the rhythm of the heart,” he notes, “that sets the beat for the entire system. The heart’s rhythmic beat influences brain processes that control the autonomic nervous system, cognitive function and emotions.” 5—(Buhner, 2004, p. 115)
...  
> Heart coherence begins when the location of consciousness is shifted from the brain to the heart, either through focus on the heart itself or on external sensory cues and how they fee—(Buhner, 2004, p. 116)

  
....  
The state of coherence has broad and very positive effects on the entire physiology as the amplification of the heart frequency through our attention to its cues creates a "louder" signal from the heart, enabling the other systems and organs and cells of the body to "phase-lock" to the heart as conductor.

> The heart is a tightly interconnected part of an oscillating, nonlinear neuronal network that is always processing electromagnetic waves within which information is encoded .—(Buhner, 2004, p. 116)
...  
> During coherence, these interconnected networks couple with one another and begin working as one synchronized system.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 117)
...  
> Against the background of the normal noise of the body, the electromagnetic field that emerges during coherence is highly detectable by the body’s cells and organs, which entrain with it, amplify its signal, and use it to alter cellular and organ functioning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 117)

  
....  
Coherence then has broad reaching physiological effects through the "hormonal cascade" that results, including the distribution and release of the various hormones the heart produces and it positive effects on the body (including the brain, and thus also our thoughts)

> As coherence begins and deepens, the entire hormonal cascade of the body alters. This hormonal shift is initiated by the heart making and releasing significantly different amounts of its hormones and neurochemicals.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 118)
...  
> During heart coherence, ANF-induced alterations immediately occur at multiple target sites throughout the body—(Buhner, 2004, p. 118)
...  
> In addition, coherence affects levels of other heart hormones, brain naturetic factor and C-type naturetic peptide, which also shift physiology and brain function, especially in the hypothalamus, adrenal glands, and pituitary gland.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 119)

  
....  
##### Alteration of perception through heart-brain entrainment (coherence)

When we enter a state of coherence through the practices explored previously, it amounts to an entrainment between the brain's electrical activity and that of the heart, with the heart setting the tone. The result of this is both a physiological and psychological change that alters cognitive processes. We enter an altered state, which makes different qualities and capacities of cognition available. Most especially, it positively alters our capacity for self-regulation, decision-making, and learning.

> Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve pathways and the baroreceptor system directly link the heart and brain, allowing communications and information to flow freely. Messages flowing from the heart to the brain during this shift to coherence significantly alter the brain’s functioning, especially in the cortex, which profoundly affects perception and learning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 119)
...  
> Shifting the focus of consciousness to the heart—and away from the forebrain—results in entrainment of large populations of cells in the forebrain to cardiac functioning (rather than vice versa). These populations of forebrain cells begin oscillating to the rhythms produced by the heart, and the perception of those populations of cells, the kinds of information they begin to process during entrainment, is very different from what they process when entrainment is not occurring.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 120)
...  
> Coordinated interactions across extracellular space lead to long-range, coordinated dynamics of heart and brain function during heart/brain entrainment. When brain neurons entrain to the heart’s ECG activity , the timing of neuronal firings alters, and research shows that the timing of neuronal firing conveys several times more information than the firing count.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 120)

  
....  

#### Brain-heart entrainment (coherence) effect on hippocampus

Additionally, this state of brain-heart entrainment has a direct effect on the hippocampus. This is (at least partially) due to the extra demand placed on the hippocampus due to the attention to external sensory cues. Thus, entrainment increasing it's activity, it's activation.

> Hippocampal activity increases considerably when cognition is shifted to the heart, heart coherence occurs, and the brain entrains to the heart.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 121)

  
....  

#### The heart-brain entrainment state of perception increases our capacity to perceive electromagnetic communications from other organism, manifest as feelings -- the hippocampus derives meaning from those feelings

As the heart not only sets an entrainment for the body itself, it also opens to increasing its (as an organ of) perception to perturbation in the EM fields it is interacting with as a result of our state of entrainment being directed towards external cues. In this state, these EM signals detected by the heart, experienced as (the 10 million colours of) feeling are sent into the brain where the hippocampus plays a role in analyzing those external feeling cues. deriving meaning from them.

> It begins sifting the electromagnetic fields the heart is detecting for embedded patterns of information, eliciting meaning from background information. The hippocampus then sends information about those meanings to the neocortex, where it is encoded as memories. The more that sensory focus is on external environments, the more activated the hippocampus and its analysis of meaning becomes.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 121)

  
....  

#### This kind of state is transient and requires both practice to cultivate and intention to enter

This kind of state is transient and requires both practice to cultivate and intention to enter. Eventually we may practice it enough to shift into it easily, or even naturally, but it still requires practice due to the contrary mode of perception we have all been conditioned to have dominate.

> This kind of synchronization does not occur spontaneously, unless people habituate heart-focused perception.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 121)
...  
> Practice in entrainment helps the brain and any other system to maintain synchronization for longer and longer periods of time.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 122)

  
....  

#### Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and its connection to overall health

HRV (heart rate variability) is a measure of the irregularly of the heart's frequency patterns within its steady beat. The greater the HRV, the healthy the heart tends to be and vice versa.

> One measure of the irregular , nonlinear activity of the heart is called heart rate variability or HRV. The resting heart, instead of beating regularly, engages in continual, spontaneous fluctuations. The heartbeat in young, healthy people is highly irregular. But heart beating patterns tend to become very regular and predictable as people get older or as their hearts become diseased. The greater the HRV, the more complex the heart’s beating patterns are and the healthier the heart is.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 122)

  
....  
As our HRV reduces, this tends to reflect not only degradation of heart function, but given the hearts involvement in emotional experience, it also reflects degradation in our emotional function.  
  
Interestingly, these are correlated such that staying in a predominately intellectual/verbal/analytical state is generally reflective of decreased HRV... and various diseases of the body reflect the same.  

These correlations, interestingly, also open up causal intervention points.

> When any system begins to lose this dynamical-chaos aspect of its functioning and becomes more predictable, it begins to lose elegance of function.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 123)
...  
> To be healthy, the heart must remain in a highly unstable state of dynamic equilibrium.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 123)

  
....  
This is because we can increase our HRV through intentional practice of entering states of coherence, and the result of increasing our HRV tends to the have correlative effects of decreasing (at least the symptomatology of) various mental/physical illnesses.   
  
We become healthier, physical and mentally/emotionally.

> Conversely, increasing heart coherence and heart/brain entrainment has shown a great many positive health effects.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 124)
...  
> Lack of cognitive focus on the body (habituation to the verbal/intellectual/analytical mode of cognition) results in disconnection and increased disorder in organ function—and is the foundation of many diseases, including heart disease.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 124)
...  
> [HRV and the heart in general] becomes even more healthy when specific kinds of emotions are activated: feelings of caring, love, and appreciation enhance internal coherence.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 124)
...  
> In the healthy heart, the varied and complex emotional mix we experience each day—generated by contact with our internal and external worlds—produces a range of heart rate patterns that is nonlinear and constantly shifting—(Buhner, 2004, p. 125)

  
....  
#### The exchange of information (dialogue) between organisms through electromagnetic frequency

All living organisms exchange information through their EM fields interacting. This is true, for example, between people, and is strongest when bodies are touching.  
  
This is not just an exchange of information, but a back and forth dialogue.

> Living organisms, including people, exchange electromagnetic energy through contact between their fields, and this electromagnetic energy carries information in much the same way radio transmitters and receivers carry music.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 125)
...  
> Thus energy, encoded with information, is transferred from one electromagnetic field to another.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 125)
...  
> for this is a living, ever-shifting dialogue.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 126)

  
....  
##### This electromagnetic dialogue can produce changes in the interacting fields, influencing each other through entrainment (sharing coherence)

This EM dialogue can produce changes in the interacting fields. Being that the strongest field in the body is the heart (and it an EM feeling perceptual organ), those are the fields that are likely to interact and thus alter in exchange with each other.  

When a person is in a state of Coherence, for example, the person they are interacting with can be brought into a state of coherence as well.

> A coherent heart affects the brain wave pattern not only of the person achieving coherence, but also of any person with whom it comes into contact.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 126)

  
....  
When they resonate/entrain, they create the third field, which is stronger and thus deepens the shared state of coherence.

> When people touch or are in close proximity , a transference of their heart’s electromagnetic energy occurs, and the two fields begin to entrain or resonate with each other. T—(Buhner, 2004, p. 126)
...  
> When a person projects a heart coherent field filled with caring, love and attention, living organisms respond to the information in the field by becoming more responsive, open, affectionate, animated, and closely connected.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 126)

  
....  

#### Healers can use coherence entrainment as a skill that supports the healing process of clients

This capacity to share a state of coherence means that people in healing professions have the capacity to support the healing of their clients through the **intentional** use and skillful wielding of their capacity to enter and project a that state of coherence.  
  
When the recipient is able to receive, this can further benefit and amplify the process.

> Healing practitioners that consciously produce coherence in the electromagnetic field of their hearts create a field that can be detected by other living systems and their biological tissues.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 126)
...  
> Thus, the best outcomes are dependent on the state of mind of the healer. Extreme importance should be attached to the kind of intention a practitioner has as he or she works. The more caring the practitioner, the more coherence there will be in their electromagnetic field and the better the healing will be—(Buhner, 2004, p. 127)
...  
> The receiver’s receptivity to the practitioner’s heart-field also plays a part in the outcome.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 127)

  
....  

##### The healing is not only supported by the coherence itself, but the altered state it brings for the healing can offer further information and direction for the healing process

However, it is not just the intention and set field, but also the altered perception that comes with it that can help with the healing process as the practitioner is, as they deepen into the state, able to more skilfully alter their own field to better meet the recipient as that recipient further opens up to reveal themselves.

> his altered perception is by nature extremely sensitive to the fabric of external electromagnetic fields and the information contained within them. As the practitioner ’s perception and their facility in using it deepens, it is possible to use it in a highly directed fashion to extract more meaning from the patient and his or her interior world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 127)

  
....  

##### This intentional coherence as a part of healing is reflected in the importance of "care" as a part of medical professions and their patients healing process.  

This intentional coherence as a part of healing is reflected in the importance of "care" as a part of medical professions and their patients healing process.  
  
Unfortunately, most people never experience this as the state of the health practitioner due to their workload and training is often very far from coherence. This not only negate the possibility of offering that kind of healing, it also blocks the practitioner from the other mode of awareness that would help them make better insights about their clients issues.

> In fact, the electromagnetic field of most medical healers is extremely incoherent, since they have been trained to use their brains to the exclusion of their hearts.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 128)

  
....  

#### The ongoing electromagnetic communications that the heart is facilitating within and without extends beyond just people and into the entire living world and all the organisms within it.  

The ongoing electromagnetic communications that the heart is facilitating within and without extends beyond just people and into the entire living world and all the organisms within it.  
  
We are effected by these fields, whether we pay attention to them or not (e.g. the circadian rhythm of our bodies are effected by the electromagnetic fields of light and dark created by our rotating so or orbit, as are other life forms).  
  
We are able though, with attention and intention, to phase lock with the fields to amplify their signal and to, in the case of heart-centered communication, derive meaning from those fields.  
  
Because of this there is the potential to enter into the heart-centered communication that was just discussed between humans with other organisms as well, as all living things have evolved to participate in this electromagnetic interchange, even the earth as a whole.

> But heart-centered communication is not limited merely to the body and other people. The heart, through its electromagnetic field, continually senses electromagnetic patterns from its environment and works to decode the information contained within them.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 129)
....
> Oscillating external electromagnetic fields can entrain or phase-lock heart cells so that the organism that we know as ourself moves into synchronicity with those electromagnetic fields.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 130)
....  
> all living organisms produce electromagnetic fields, all encode information, and all merged electromagnetic fields exchange information. The Earth itself is a living organism that produces electromagnetic fields filled with information. We are affected by the information encoded in these fields just by living on the Earth. —(Buhner, 2004, p. 129)
....  
> Living organisms, over long evolutionary time, have learned to use these fields as a communication medium, to intentionally insert information into them—(Buhner, 2004, p. 130)

  
....  
#### The Nervous System of Plants and their capacity to communicate internally and externally though electromagnetic signals.
  
Plants have nervous systems, too. 
  
Plants are an example of organism we can enter into a phase locked heart-centered communication with, as they two have a kind of nervous system evolved to be in communications within themselves, the elements (photosynthesis), other organisms (for defence or symbiosis) as a part of their intelligence, their capacity to perceive, adapt, and respond to events in their environment. This amounts to them being able to perceive and send, decode and encode meanings, through electromagnetic signals.

> In many respects, plant nervous systems are nearly as sophisticated as our own, and in some plants, nearly as rapid in their actions. Plant nervous systems possess synapses, just as our brains do, and they make and use neurotransmitters that are molecularly identical to those that are found in our brains. They use these neurotransmitters to facilitate the function of their central nervous system, just as we do.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 131)
....  
> Plant nervous systems perform many of the same duties ours do—they help process, decipher, and coordinate external and internal impulses to maintain the functioning of the organism. And a major element of this functioning is their recognition of signals, their decoding of meaning, and their crafting of responses.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 131)

  
....  

#### We have a capacity to be in an intentional living dialogue with the world through our capacity to tune into the cues coming from the world

We have a capacity to be in an intentional living dialogue with the world through our capacity to tune into the cues coming from the world, manifesting as feeling perceptions that can be decoded as meanings through our capacity to enter into a heart-centered awareness and thus heart-centered communication with the world, humans and non humans alike.

> And we, like plants, are evolutionarily designed to encounter such fields, just as the generators of those fields are designed to encounter us. The meanings embedded within those fields, experienced by us as emotions, affect the heart’s rate, hormonal cascade, pressure waves, and neurochemical activity. Directed emotions—intentional, informational electromagnetic embeds sent outward—affect those external electromagnetic fields in turn. Through such directed communication and perception, a living dialogue occurs between us and the world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 132)

  
....  
### CHAPTER SIX -- THE SPIRITUAL HEART -- AISTHESIS

.....
#### The reductionist, quantifiable model for this kind of communication is not what is important --- Feeling the touch of the world is important

All that what was explored before might have explanatory value, but is it ultimately just a metaphor. The reductionist, quantifiable model for this kind of communication is not what is important.  
  
What is important is the living reality of experience this communication, this heart-centred perception, and what this awakens for us in our experience of being life in living dialogue with life.  
  
What is important is that we feel it, that we feel "the touch of the world upon us".

> The important thing is not that the heart is an intricate pump or even that it creates electromagnetic fields that other people can feel or through which we can communicate. The important thing is that we exist, immersed in living fields of communication, all of which are imbued with meaning, generated by intelligent life forms, and flow from and to us from the moment the cells of our bodies self-organize into the unique identities that we know as ourselves.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 135)
.... 
> We feel the touch of the world upon us, and those millions of unique touches hold within them specific meanings, sent to us from the heart of the world and from the heart of the living beings with which we inhabit this world—(Buhner, 2004, p. 135)

  
....  
#### The meaning of Aisthesis -- Being touched by, and touching the World

These feeling of being touched by the world is what the Greek called Aisthese, the exchange of life force between organisms.  
  
This exchange goes both ways, human and non-human alike.

> Aisthesis denotes the moment in which a flow of life force, imbued with communications, moves from one living organism to another. The word literally means “to breathe in.” It is a taking in of the world, a taking in of soulful communications that arise from the living phenomena in that world—(Buhner, 2004, p. 136)
....  
> Often overlooked is the crucial understanding that at the same time, the world takes us in too—we are breathed in as well—(Buhner, 2004, p. 136)

  
....  

#### The perception of the linear mind kills the world through disconnection and reduction of our capacity to feel it's aliveness

The brain centric perceptions we have been conditioned to prioritize is the result or (and contributor to) the murder of the world's soul in our minds. It make the world dead, and contained us within the linearity of analysis and deconstruction and reduction, disconnecting us from a heart-based perceptions capacity to empathically touch and be touched by the wholeness of the world and is various beings.

> Though the brain is important, it is merely an organic computer, useful for processing data and acting as a clearing station for central nervous system functioning. Unlike the heart, with its connected empathic perceptions the brain has no inherent moral nature—(Buhner, 2004, p. 137)
....  
> the more the brain is used as the primary organ of perception, the more life is reduced. It becomes merely an expression of mechanical forces with no intelligence or purpose, and all life forms are judged and valued depending on their capacity for this kind of analytical processing—(Buhner, 2004, p. 138)

  
....  

#### The capacity to feel the touch of the world, and exchange life force with other organisms through our hearts, is an evolutionary birthright.

That we can feel this touch, this exchange of life force between organism (an each organisms uniqueness) is sewn into the very foundations of us as creatures of the earth. It is and was a birthright since the dawn of humanity, and a state our forbearers encountered as a regular aspect of their daily lives.  
  
Our hearts have evolved to do this, to perceive and remember and engage the aliveness of the world and it's various inhabitants.

> this basic experience—this aisthesis—has been at the root of human relationship with the world since our evolutionary expression out of the Earth. We are built to experience it, to be aware that each thing possesses a unique identity, its own particular eachness. We are made for the nature of each thing to pass into us through our hearts, which think about it, store memories about it, and engage in dialogue with it.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 139)

  
....  
##### However, this perceptual skill requires practice 

But, as natural as it is, it is atrophied and rarely activated within us, and furthermore being able to use it as a skill, as a perceptual skill that enables conscious communication, is something that must be practiced to developed into fluency (like any skill, or any language)

> Like all developed human skills, it takes years of exploring and experimenting with the perceptual capacities of the heart for it to become sophisticated, just as it takes years to develop fluency with verbal language.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 139)

  
....  
### CHAPTER SEVEN -- THE DOOR INTO NATURE

  
....  
#### The plants may not talk to you if you do not respect them as equals

The plants may not talk to you if you do not respect them as equals. Consider the example of being a man and whether a woman would talk to you, really, if you held in mind that she was an inferior being because she didn't think as well as you.  

> If you do not feel that it is at least the same to you as a human being (it is better if you understand it is superior), then I am not sure it will talk to you.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 150)

  
....  

#### Some plants are quieter than others, and we need to train our perception to become more open to this

Some plants are quieter than others, and we need to train our perception to become more open to this. (e.g. psilocybin talks much louder than rosemary

> The cultivation of a delicacy of perception allows us to hear the quiet ones, the ones whose doctoring is most subtle. The polite ones. The ones who wait for us to speak before they respond.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 150)

  
....  

#### What it takes to start our journey into communicate with plants

The chapter is about what it takes to start our journey into communicate with plants.  

Part of this is first cultivating a kind of respect for them, and a manner of approach that acknowledged them as at least on the same level as us, if not superior (e.g. as our elders). This first step is the cultivation of regard and a manner of approach that allows us to see and step through "The Door Into Nature".  

  
> The first step in learning to talk to plants is cultivating politeness—(Buhner, 2004, p. 150)
...  
> The first step is to respect our elders.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 151)
....
> The door is in Nature, but only by giving up what you think you know about Nature, by being willing to know nothing, is the door found.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 154)

Over the course of the chapter he reinforces that this is something we learn over time and it requires that we unlearn our linear/reductionist/organized/analytical was of thinking so we can step out into Nature and let the green intelligence (Veriditas) touch us, and only though that direct, lived, felt, experience can we develop the personal language (non-verbal) for that communication.  

....

#### Communication with plants is often through non-verbal means
  
This communication can be interpreted in language, and can speak to us through our own inner monologue, but most often that language is not verbal. It is through feeling and through the whole of our experience as in manifest through various aspects in relation to various elements.

> You are learning a different kind of language now, and you must be suspicious of the word. Words are the domain of the linear mind; only the heart can hear the language of plants. And words kill the perceptions of the heart.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 151)

  
....  

#### Part of learning to communicate with plants involves unlearning our civility (but not our ethics)

Part of this learning involves unlearning our civility (but not our ethics) .. civility means order by the law, human law, linear laws.

> When you go into wilderness, something happens, something that civilization does not like. (That’s why they cut it down, you know.)—(Buhner, 2004, p. 152)

  
....  

##### Veriditas is being touched by the living intelligence of plants, and is the antidote to the conditioning of the civilized world.

Veriditas is being touched by the living intelligence of plants, and is the antidote to conditioning of the civilized world.

> The discomfort with disordered nonlinearity, the fearful desire to be so regular and clean-shaven, has an antidote: the green, living intelligence of plants.   Veriditas—(Buhner, 2004, p. 152)

  
....  
##### This unlearning is an act of courage

This unlearning, the letting go of what we think we know and how we were told is the correct way to know is an act of courage, and the first act of courage in the journey to communicating with plants

> the first step in gathering knowledge from the heart of the world is to go into the world on your own, abandoning your preconceptions. The first act of courage—(Buhner, 2004, p. 153)

  
....  

#### Communicating with plants is a direct lived experience, not a mental exercise

This is a direct, lived experience. It is not a concept of a mental exercise and what we think we know is a barrier to that experience.  
  

> It is a living experience that you will find, not a mental construct. The things you think you know, that you have been taught, will get in your way if you do not agree, at least for now, to abandon them.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 153)

  
....  


  

### CHAPTER EIGHT --  THE NECESSITY FOR ACUITY OF PERCEPTION


....  

#### Using our senses to experience the world without interpretations led by linear/analytical thinking.  

The next step in learning to talk with plants is using our senses to experience the world without interpretations led by linear/analytical thinking.  
  
We evolved to directly experiences the world through our senses. To open the gates of our senses and move through the work of attending to the feelings that comes along with that (not just to walk around up in our head all the time)

> Our senses are meant to perceive the world. They developed with and from the world, not in isolation. Using them is the act that opens the door that is in Nature.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 156)
....  
> human senses emerged from immersion within the world. They are part of Earth, an expression of communicative contact subtly refined and shaped through long association.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 157)

  
....  
#### Awakening the whole body as an organ of perception

This attention to the ongoing now-ness of sensory experiences is a quality of perception, it is an act that awakens the whole body as an organ of perception. This experiences is something connects back to the natural world of which we are an expression, and from which we have divorced ourselves through our civilization.

> Focusing on the continuous flow of sensory data coming from the world around us activates our sensing bodies as organs of perception , leaves the computer behind, and embeds us once again within the world in which our species was born—(Buhner, 2004, p. 157)

  
....  
##### Instead of thinking, sense --- sensing as thinking
Attend to sensation such that the thinking mind is quiet and perception is led by sensation. Instead of thinking, sense.

> Allow your sensory perceptions to be your thinking. Sense instead of think.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 157)
> ....  

....  
Whereas the linear mind is made of and for lines and boundaries, sensation without linearity dissolves those lines.

The _sensing as thinking_ state opens us to connection as our senses open is like a door open to the world.  

The door opens through direct sense perception, opening further the deeper into sensing we go

> Attending to sensory communications from the world dissolves the boundary between self and world. It is a crucial act in reconnecting ourselves with the life of Earth. Sensory perception is the natural and right blending of inner and outer.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 158)
 
....  

##### We are not trying to stop the thinking mind, but replace thinking with direct sensory perception

It is important to remember that we are not trying to stop the thinking mind, as this will never work. We are building our capacity to, willfully and with intention, replace the thinking mind with direct sensory perception.  
  
This is something that will be wavering at first but, as we further awaken our body to this capacity, will be come natural enough that it can entirely replace thinking when we chose to.

> You cannot stop the linear mind, leaving nothing in its place.   
> it resents destructive approaches   
> The work is simple. Do something else instead.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 161)
....
> As your body becomes more and more alive through the activation of your senses, sensing is what you do instead of thinking.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 161)

  
....  
##### We must rebuild our atrophied capacity to be in that direct sense perception

As we spend years of our lives with our sense of self and experience of consciousness positioned "in our heads" we atrophy our capacity to be in that direct sense perception,

> Habitual location of consciousness in the brain—our long immersion in the analytical mind—atrophies the capacity for sense perception.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 159)


##### Letting go our of linear mind to lean into sense perception as primary is the second act of courage

The second act of courage in our journey of communicating with plants is to let go of the linear mind and all the baggage of judgement that comes with not using it, and to lean into your sense perception as primary, as a channel between you and the world (as they were meant to be used, evolved to be used)  

> the second act of courage is deciding to trust your senses.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 159)

  
....  

##### Learning direct sensory perception is best done in the wilds

Learning to use our senses as perception, and to use them effectively, is best done out of the cites and nestled the breathing life the natural world.

> And to use your senses most productively , you must go out from the cities.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 160)

  
....  
##### Step by step instruction on practicing direct sensory perception in the forest

>[!Tip] ...
> There is a long section in this chapter where he walks you through the practice of engaging direct sensory perception in the forest. The following is the first step, and it continues from there. 
> >Take a few deep breaths when you arrive, settling yourself down deep in your body. Then begin to walk.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 160)

  
....  

##### Be careful how language is used while in this sensing perception, language like 4 year old

Be careful how language is used while in this sensing perception. If we get to analytical/classifying, we lose the state. If we are to use language in our heads, keep it very simple. Like how a 4 year old would describe a thing

> Keep your botany out of this! Do not classify! Do not use big, scientific words!—(Buhner, 2004, p. 163)
....  
> As you describe, speak as if you were a four-year-old. “Fuzzy,” a child says. “Pointy.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 163)

  
....  
#### Microdose the forest

Here is speaks of tasting plants as a part of the sensory perception practice. This reminded me of the "forest microdosing" concept, which I wrote about [[Microdosing the Forest|here]].

> Now hold the living leaf in your mouth.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 164)

....  
Depending on where you are, there aren't that many poisonous plants such that you can't nibble on them.

> What if it’s poisonous?   One of our greatest fears is to eat the wildness of the world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 164)

  
....  
#### The wilds of nature can be disorienting and uncomfortable, at first

This journey into the wilds of nature can be disorienting and uncomfortable as we lose the human-centric orientation points we have grown to rely upon as cues of comfort and safety. This will take time, and will be lonely, at least in the beginning.

> In Nature, human markers fade, lose significance. It takes awhile to learn the old markers again, to see the path that ancient humans took before us. In kindness, learn how to comfort yourself, to hold yourself as you would a child that is afraid of the light. (I suppose you could learn the poisonous plants first if you need to; there aren’t very many.) For on this journey, you mostly have yourself for company.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 165)



### CHAPTER NINE --- FEELING WITH THE HEART

....  

#### Touching the hidden face of Nature

When we shift from taking in the plant we are connecting with with our familiar senses (sight, touch, smell. sound, taste) into feeling as a sense perception--feeling with the heart--we are able to touch "the hidden face of Nature".

> Eventually you have to move from looking and go into feeling, realizing that feeling is a sense, too. Not the touch of the fingers, but the touch of the heart. This kind of touch has another dimension, deeper than that possessed by the fingers.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 168)
....  
> The hidden face of Nature can only be seen with the heart.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 168)

  
....  

#### Electromagnetic pulses as communication, experienced as feeling, decoded into meaning 

All living things in Nature are expressing EM pulses, which are a form of communication, and within that communication are meanings that we can experience as feelings when we open ourselves to be touched by them.

> Everything we encounter in the wildness of the world gives off its own electromagnetic pulse of communication. These waveforms are filled with meanings, living communications that touch us and that we experience as feelings.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 168)


  
....  

#### Feelings as sense perceptions of the external world

Feelings do not necessarily come from within us. They can be sense perceptions of the external world. We need to be able to let those feelings in, and afford them the value of acknowledgment and attention. This is how we can connect/communication with plants, but it requires this capacity to open to receive from the plant.  

This opening ourselves to receive the communications from the plant, though feeling, is the third step in the process.  
  
*This section of the book has a long exploration of what this might look like as a practice, from first steps to development over time*

> You must open your heart and let the plant’s living communications flow into you, weave through you. You must receive what it has to offer.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 171)
  
....  

#### The world touches us through the intimation of feelings when we open ourselves to be touched by the world.  

The world touches us through the intimation of feelings when we open ourselves to be touched by the world.  

Those intimations contain information, communications with meanings that can be amplified and learned from.

> All phenomena, when focused upon, will generate an intimation of a particular mood or quality within you. We are daily touched by the world within which we are embedded, we feel that touch upon us in the thousands of nameless feelings we experience each day. They flit over the surface of our consciousness like shadows across a grassy meadow. In paying attention to them, they come forward into consciousness and begin to reveal their secrets, for each emotion registers the impact of a particular meaning that has touched us. They are transforms of information, of communications, from the world around us. These transforms contain extremely condensed and elegant communications about what we are encountering.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 173)
.....
> Feel your heart touch the plant, and in that touching, connect with it at all possible points of interface.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 175)

  
....  

##### We evolved to feel the touch of the world, but have removed ourselves from it.

This is how we evolved to exist in the world. Yet, we have effectively removed ourselves from it.  

> We are meant to feel the touch of the world upon us.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 174)

  
....  

##### The initial intimation of feeling of a plant is what we return to over and over as we learn it

There is an initial intimation of feeling that we experiences when we first open ourselves to a plant. This is an important aspect of our ongoing connection with it as that initial feeling is like the signature of the plant, remembering it is like remembering a person's face.  
  
We come back to it over and over again as we learn from it over time.

> This initial intimation, the impression or mood, the feeling of the plant, is the beginning of your connection to its being. Firmly anchor it into your experience.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 174)
....  
> it is to this initial impression that you will return over and over as you refine your knowledge of the plant you are studying.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 174)

  
....  

##### These feelings are both of us and of the external world simultaneously

The feelings that we encounter in this state of opening ourselves to being touched by the world come from the world, but they are not distinct from us. We are a part of that communication, the feelings that arises in us are reflective of an openness to the world that allows that which we are touched by to touched by us receiving it.

> Know that these feelings are encoded communications from the world around you, transforms of messages. But they are not feelings from which you can remain distant.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 174)

...  

> It is the beginning of an intimacy with life, a mode of living in which you are never alone, in which communications come from the world to you and go out from you to the world. It is a way of being.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 174)

  
....  

##### We can send messages to plants, too

We can be conscious agents in our engagement in this kind of communication through intentionally sending messages to plants. We do this by extending our heart perception to being touched by the plant, and then feeling and sending feeling to the plant, such as care.  
  
This kind of offering of care is a well supported

> You can extend this, deepen it, go even further. Feeling the touch of the plant upon you is only the first step. You can also touch it in return, intend communication with it as well.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 175)

  
....  

##### The plants are open to reach, if you are willing to learn

The plants are open to communicating with you, teaching you, if you are willing to ask and to open your heart to learn.

> Plants will, if genuinely asked, respond to you. They will teach you their medicine, as plants have always taught human beings. And though human beings may lose the knowledge of the medicinal uses of a plant, the plant always remembers what its medicine is. And they will tell you . . . if you ask. If you approach them with an open heart, open your senses and truly allow yourself to perceive them, they will always respond.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 178)

....  

##### We need to be willing to love plants, though

Loving plants is what allows us to receive their communications, and from this loving place we can ask in earnest and the plants will response.

> You only have to love them, to feel the touch of their communications on your heart, and send out your deep request in turn. They will respond to you if you ask, for that is what plants are meant to do.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 179)
  
....  

#### If the world is dead in our minds, then there is no reason to ask before we take

To (most) scientists, the world is dead. There is no reason to ask, as there is nothing to ask, and thus they just take instead.

> The problem with scientists—with those who think the world is a dead place—is that they never ask. They take . . . in the name of science.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 178)



#### Building intimacy with a plant has effects on the brain
  
The effect of the kind of intimacy we are building with a plants has an effect on the brain. We build neural pathways to accord for what is learned in that relationship, what is felt and remembered as feelings. As such, from that point onwards we can always connect with the plant by remembering those feelings.

> This deep intimacy and sharing flows directly from the heart into the memory centers of the brain; the hippocampus alters its functioning, and new neurons and neuronal pathways are created. The memories that are encoded are deep, the key to accessing them the remembered feelings of the event itself. When you recall the plant and this moment of touch, the memories will flood back as fresh as if they happened only moments ago.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 179)

  
....  

#### Entraining ourselves to the flow of life in things through heart-attention to them

Being able to connect ourselves into the flow of life, to be entrained to the flow of life around and through us, is innate in us and we do it through bringing "heart-attention" to that which we seek to entrain with.  

This is how we can connect with the intelligence of whatever plant we are looking to talk with, and the meanings embedded in its communications.

> We have an innate capacity to entrain ourselves, to establish a harmony of patterning, a rapport, with anything upon which our heart-attention is focused. When you emotionally hook yourself to a living thing, you anchor yourself to the nonlinear flow of its life. As your connection is deepened, you begin to flow with its life patterns; you absorb its meanings, its intelligence, and its particular point of view—(Buhner, 2004, p. 181)

  
....  

#### The "medicine" of the plant (or of an experience) is literally the feelings we experience.

> These feelings are your connection to the living reality of the plant. The complex gestalt of plant communications that you experience as feelings is (not metaphorically, but literally) the medicine of the plant.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 182)
....  
> The feelings are the medicine. At this moment, the medicine is simply encoded in one particular form.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 182)

  
....  
##### It is through those feelings that we connect with and learn the medicine of a plant

With respect to learning how to work with a plant medicinally, that feeling medicine is "the one true thing" that allows us to learn its medicinal capacity.

> The one true thing is the complex of feelings that you experience from that phenomenon, that plant.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 183)
....  
> This one true thing, this initial, powerful intimation, this burst of communication from the plant, is the most important thing of all.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 183)

  
....
### SECTION TWO --  THE TASTE OF WILD WATER  
  
### CHAPTER TEN   --- GATHERING KNOWLEDGE FROM THE HEART OF THE WORLD

....  

#### Learning a plant means increasing our intimacy with it, which takes time, intention, and care

Increasing your knowledge of a plant you are learning from requires increasing your intimacy with it over time. Like getting to know anyone, This takes time, intention, and care

> To increase your knowledge your level of intimacy must increase. You must come to know the plant even better.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 187)
....  
> The intimacy deepens when you take time to foster it, when you focus on the plant and take the time to really come to know it.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 187)

  
....  
##### The learning will come in bouts

The learning will come in bouts, and there will be long periods of time where there doesn't seem to be much happening. When further knowledge is discovered, it will come in bursts. These then add to your knowledge of the plant, which becomes part of the relationship you continue to develop over time, which means it adds to the basis upon which further bursts of knowledge will be discovered.

> One day you awake and, taking a walk, as you pass the plant in the field, of a sudden a deeper knowledge of the plant and its purposes, its uses as medicine, will flash into your mind.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 188)
....  
> This deeper knowledge becomes part of your understanding of the plant, part of the fabric of your relationship.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 188)

  
....  

##### The relationship eventually becomes a shared being

Eventually, this relationship will grow and deepen enough so for there to be a communication between you that is like a shared being, shared breathing, they come alive within you, your lives intwined.

> During this enhanced, directed focus, your awareness will begin to interweave with the living reality of the phenomenon, your perception to develop into an active beholding of its ever-living, moment-to-moment reality. Through your immersion and directed focus the phenomenon will eventually—come alive within you in an entirely new way. The two of you will interweave together at an extremely deep level of contact—your life interwoven with its life, your being shaped by its living presence—(Buhner, 2004, p. 190)
....  
> It is not necessary to actually be in the presence of the plant when you engage in this deepening of perception.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 190)

  
....  

##### Learning the plant requires an oscillation back and forth between heart and brain perception, heart as primary

The learning doesn't, however, require solely heart-perception. There must be an oscillation back and forth, allowing for what was received and encounter in the heart-perception to be registered and integrated by the brain in order to become usable knowledge.  
  
The heart and brain work together, although the heart is primary.

> The disengagement with the phenomenon, the slight stepping away from immediate experience, allows the brain to momentarily reactivate. The pattern of meaning within the phenomenon is then interpreted by those portions of the brain concerned with meaning; understanding then arises within you in a new form. The meanings from the plant are encoded in discrete linguistic descriptions and bursts of understanding.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 192)

  
....  
that usable knowledge is effectively the meaning encoded in the communications (experienced as feelings) and decoded by your brain.


> Each emotional tone, intimation, or mood felt in response to a phenomena is an expression of meaning. And it is this meaning, or series of meanings, that you are working to turn into usable knowledge.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 192)

  
....  
These meanings cannot be forced, but must be allowed to arise organically, of their own accord.

> During this process, the verbal–analytical mode of consciousness does not invent the linguistic phrases to describe the meaning of the phenomenon; instead, the linguistic descriptions of the phenomenon emerge of their own accord out of the store of memories, information, and experiences that you have accumulated during your lifetime. Here the heart and brain work together, the systole and diastole of understanding.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 192)

  
....  
And the heart is primary in this process

> Remember: the heart is the primary organ of perception here; the brain supplies only a secondary , supportive role. The verbal/intellectual/analytical mode of cognition used by the brain is the servant of the process. Thinking by itself will never get you to these deeper understandings.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 193)

  
....  
He outlines what this looks like over the preceding paragraph, and how the brain part of this is less like analysis and more like momentary (as in seconds) of space where one is not trying to think about things, but simply letting the brain do what it does as knowledge emerges out of the information gathered through feeling in a burst of "linguistically encoded meaning"

> This allows the mind to generate a gestalt of understanding that captures the meanings that have given rise to the particular emotional tones you experienced. This understanding comes in a burst, a flash of linguistically encoded meaning. The knowledge emerges, seemingly of itself.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 194)

However, it is essential that we return to the feeling (that first truth, initial intimation of feeling we got from the plant) to feeling-check that knowledge/understanding against the living felt reality of the plant.

> However, each understanding must be emotionally compared to the living phenomenon, to the plant itself, to check it for accuracy .—(Buhner, 2004, p. 194)
  
....  

This is a process we must undergo over and over again, for a long time, as a part of our relationships with the plant. Eventually, though, this will all add up to a moment where the entire plant is revealed to your mind, the wholeness of its being exists within you.

> You must reengage with the phenomenon and repeat the process over and over and over again until, in a burst of understanding, an articulation of the meanings occurs naturally within you in a gestalt filled with highly charged understanding, complete and whole. It is in this moment that the plant stands revealed to you, the moment when it has completely unconcealed itself—(Buhner, 2004, p. 196)

  
....  
Of course, even as we do this over and over again, and get deeper and deeper, we will always fall back into analytical mind and go on adventures in intellectualisms, unawares. This is normal, we just need to bring ourselves back.  

We must be cautious of this, both in our learning, but also because of bypassing.

> You will find, however , that as you engage in this process, and before you reach the point where you perceive the phenomenon its own light, you will, from time to time, go off on intellectual tangents. This is inevitable.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 196)

  
....  

#### Encountering with the wholeness of the being of the plant 

This part of the book felt beyond me, but seemed to be describing a kind of psychedelic encounter with the wholeness of the being of the plant itself wherein we can directly engage the plant like a reality onto itself, full of information about it. This happens within "the imaginal"

> suspended in a moment of pregnant pause. And in that moment, you will literally see multiple aspects of the plant as living expressions of itself. Its medicinal actions, its purpose in the ecosystem, its relations to other plants, how it appeared in ancient times in other habitats—even what its ancestors looked like—all will be revealed.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 199)

  
....  

#### Active and intentional engagement to influence what meanings we receive

We do not just show up, neutral, and receive. How we show up influences what we receive. We can apply this in our learning, exploration, and engagement with natural spaces.

> We do not merely engage with meanings already present in the world; we can also initiate the communicative emergence of particular meanings that we, ourselves, need. And the plants, feeling the touch of our heart communications upon them, will hear and respond.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 202)

  
....  

##### Finding plants in the forest through attunement

For example, if we are seeking a plant we know in the forest, we an attune ourselves to that plant in advance through holding it in mind. Feeling it deeply. Then when we enter the forest it is as if we are sending out a request, and we will receive cues that direct us to find that plant.

> If you desire to harvest particular medicines, plants that you already know and need for some particular thing, before you go, feel the need you have for them, and feel it strongly . Then see the plant in your imaginal vision, and let its reality enter you.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 202)

  
....  
Or, if we are seeking a plant we don't know to address a suffering we carry, we can enter into the forest holding the deep need for that suffering to be alleviated, which sends up that request (communications) such that we will receive cues that lead us to find the plant that fulfils that need.

> At times you may find that you need a plant that you do not know in order to meet some need within you, some suffering that you or another person have.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 203)
....  
> The emotional power of this need will alter the communications embedded within your heart’s electromagnetic field, and they will travel out before you, powerfully impacting everything they touch. Then when you enter the woodlands, the wildness of the world, one particular plant will respond to you most strongly.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 203)

  
### CHAPTER ELEVEN --- THE PREGNANT POINT AND THE MUNDUS IMAGINALIS

(Buhner, 2004, p. 206)

  
....  

#### The Pregnant point is...

The Pregnant point is the point of spacious but acute awareness just as the meaning of something previously ambiguous becomes spontaneously realized.


> the pregnant point   
> 
> In that moment of pause, your mind is not thinking, your heart is not feeling; you are perceiving directly a specific truth that has burst on your awareness and now holds all of your attention. In this moment—when the meaning of the thing you have been attending to bursts into awareness you are held for a moment, suspended in time, caught up in the individuality of the thing you have perceived and understood.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 208)

##### The pregnant point in the realization of the plant as a whole

With respect to learning a plant, overtime, eventually, the meanings that were threads in our communication with the plant can spontaneously burst into an awareness where the whole of the plant is realized.  

That moment is a pregnant point.
....  

The pregnant point exists in dimension where meaning and its realization meet the something greater then the sum of its parts that is life. 

> It is a dimension concerned with relationships and the tension between parts and that unidentifiable something that comes when a grouping of parts suddenly unifies into one coordinated whole, when it self-organizes and begins demonstrating emergent behaviors.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 209)

  
....  

#### The Steps to Communicating with Plants

[[The Steps To Communicating With Plants According to Stephen Harrod Buhner|See note here]]

> The first step is attending to the sensory impressions that come into the body from the plant. The second is attending to the feelings that these sensory impulses generate. The third is focusing on the meanings that are encoded within these feelings, the meanings that we experience as feelings.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 210)

  
....  
>[!tip] Hippocampus supports the pregnant point moment of meaning realization
>
He proposes that this process is a hippocampal one, that of sewing together the various elements of sensory experience into feelings, and then into meanings. The meanings and then the pregnant point come from the hippocampus (had a hard time finding a way to describe this that wasn't "brain causes experience")  
>
Meaning perception is rooted in more places in the brain than the hippocampus, but it does seem that the hippocampus is involved in "high-resolution" stitching of various aspects of perception with memory in order to contribute to our perception. So this does link.

  
....  

#### It is not about what can be explained, but what can be experienced

> But remember, the hippocampus is only a part of what is happening, it is not you. This is an interweaving of living beings, not a static, linear, mental process. It is meant to be experienced not explained away.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 211)

  
....  

#### Spontaneous insights about the plants through intuition

Stephen Harrod Buhner, in writing about communicating with plants, speaks to the importance following your interests while returning over and over again to the the initial intimation of feeling that came when we first followed that interest towards a particular plant. 

He speaks to how doing so can guide one's subconscious mind to help them have spontaneous realizations about that plant. Including the spontaneous emergence of the wholeness of the plant in your mind.

> If you keep repeating this process with anything you are interested in, that you are drawn to, that you are working to understand, there will be a moment when you slightly back off and the wholeness of the thing will burst into consciousness, just as the giraffe did. There will be a moment when you directly experience the depth livingness of the phenomenon within you, understand and internally hold a gestalt of its meaning, just as you did with the giraffe.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 212)
....  
> The continual focus of your intention through the days and weeks after first meeting lets the deeper parts of you know that you are truly insistent on knowing.   
> that you are serious   
> They work to find the meaning even while you sleep. At a level lower than conscious awareness, throughout each day, they work to understand.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 212)
....  
> There will come a moment   
> always   
> when the wholeness of the phenomenon bursts upon you. —(Buhner, 2004, p. 212)
....  
> There is an immediate putting together of all these bits of knowledge into one whole gestalt, which flashes onto the surface of the mind in one tiny moment of time.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 213)

  
....  
#### Imagination vs the imaginal

Imagination is not the conjuring of images in our mind when it is done through heart-perception. It becomes an interior representations of the otherwise unseen reality of things in the living world. The "mundus imaginalis" or the imaginal.

> Within the linear mode of consciousness, imagination is the generation of a series of thought pictures that have their relation only to the linear mode of cognition. But when the heart is the primary organ of perception, imagination is something else. It is the kind of thinking that is done with the heart.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 214)
....  
> This is the imagination that the great Islamic scholar Henri Corbin termed the mundus imaginalis, literally “world imagination.” What he actually meant by the term was the imagination through which the true nature of the world is perceived. It is, in fact, a specific kind of seeing, a specific kind of perceiving.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 214)

....  

> At the pregnant point, consciousness can rotate its orientation and look along any axis of reality of the plant or disease.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 215)

  
....  

#### The living whole of the plant alive within us to learn from

When we have come to the pregnant point and the whole of a thing has been realized within us, that living whole can be held within the imaginal such that we can interact with it as the living thing that it is. We can explore it, learn from it, discover it, etc all though the capacity now for us to "touch" it with out hearts and feel its meanings.

> During this process you let the living field of your heart move within the living image within you. The heart, at this point, is feeling its way. Its touch is highly refined now, like the fingers of a man blind from birth. It is feeling meaning. Just as with eyes closed sensitive fingers can follow a rough thread along the surface of a coat, the heart now follows threads of meaning woven through the being of the plant.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 216)

  
....  
These felt meanings are then processed by the brain into intelligible understandings.

> As the heart follows the threads of meaning through the three dimensional image within it, the meanings your heart encounters are directly routed to the brain for analysis.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 216)

  
....  
Then we go back and compare the brain meaning to the feeling meaning, they should be congruent

> You feel the meaning that the brain has generated and compare it to the feeling of the meaning that you are following.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 217)
....  
> The two feelings should be congruent; their waveforms should overlap. They should be a reflection of one another. A mirror image.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 217)

>[!tip] From pieces to wholes; from wholes to a non-linear flow of wholeness
This chapter continues on to explore and outline the experience of this process of the back and forth progression of learning a plant, getting from pieces to wholes, and from aspects of the whole to a continuous non-linear flow of wholeness.

  
....  
#### Plant chemistries are a form of language, related to electromagnetic communications of meaning  
  

> Any particular chemical a plant makes is made in response to communications. Plant chemistries are a specific form of language, and they arise, they are made, in response to the plant perceiving directed meaning and responding in kind—(Buhner, 2004, p. 219)

....  

> Each molecular structure a plant makes is surrounded by its own, unique electromagnetic field each electromagnetic field is encoded with meaning and each can be perceived by the finely tuned field of your heart, understood through the focused power of your consciousness.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 219)

....  

> Each individual plant makes thousands of chemical compounds, all of which are biologically active and full of impact. But these compounds are transforms of messages. They are communications. And it is not necessary to understand plant chemistry to understand their communications. A degree in English is not necessary to understand this sentence, and training in plant chemistry is not necessary to understand the language of plants.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 220)

  
....  

#### Metaphor is irrelevant, meaning is what matters

[[The metaphors are irrelevant, meaning is what matters|extracted quote here]]

> The metaphors themselves are irrelevant, it is the perceived meaning that is important. —(Buhner, 2004, p. 221)

  
....  

#### A plant's capacity to heal is not in the chemicals, but in the meanings it carries

A plant's capacity to heal is not in the chemicals, but in the meanings it carries, the spirit of the plant. The chemicals are just the transport body for those meanings.  
  

> For its power to heal is in the meaning; its chemical form serves only a secondary function. It contains the meaning but it is not the meaning, just as the giraffe figure contains the figure but is not the figure. For it is the meaning, the spirit of the plant, that heals the disease. The plant chemical merely gives it a form in which to travel. And although this form does help our bodies, form to form, we are not (solely) our physical form, and the disease is not (usually) merely a physical form, like a virus.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 221)
  
....  
##### The extracted chemical alone can the deeper meaning that provides the healing a plant can offer.  

> The plant chemical itself, without the meaning inserted into it, is like a word without meaning. Like saying, “I love you,” to someone when your heart is closed. Such an empty phrase possesses a weight very different than one filled with meaning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 222)

  
....  

#### We alienate ourselves from life when we remove the perception of life from the world around us

We alienate ourselves from life when we remove the perception of life from the world around us. Not only in our mind, but in our actions as what purpose is there in building a relationship with something that isn't there?

> For if the things we experience outside ourselves are only matter, dumb, unfeeling, insentient life forms—rocks, or atoms, or air—then there is no need to truly notice them. No need to merge with them in a participatory consciousness. The livingness of the world is reduced down and in this reduction the imaginal has become merely the imaginary.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 225)

  
....  
### SECTION THREE -- THE FRUITFUL DARKNESS  
### CHAPTER TWELVE --- DEPTH DIAGNOSIS AND THE HEALING OF HUMAN DISEASE

#### The same process by which we can come to communicate with a plant, can be used healing through applying the perceptual capacity to another person.

The same process by which we can come to communicate with a plant, can be used healing through applying the perceptual capacity to another person.  

This chapter was essentially walking us through this process.  
  
It seems very similar to how I assume "Shamans" healing people. Especially the old way of ayahuasca curanderos who drink the ayahuasca and then observe you (rather than you drinking the ayahuasca)  
  
> The process is the same as that used to find the medicinal use of a plant. Only now your gaze is directed at a person. The intention is to know that person’s disease, the diseased organ itself, and what it needs.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 230)

  
....  
#### Any part can give way to the whole.  
  
It is in following that part which most interests you that becomes the path to lead you to the whole of the thing.

> Any aspect of the phenomenon will ultimately reveal the whole phenomenon itself, will allow your entry into its living reality. The part that draws your attention is the doorway that is most open to you. It is with this axis of the phenomenon’ s multidimensionality that you must start.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 232)


....  
#### You may feel their pain, do not turn away

Hold the pain, do not turn away, you are there to help them hold it as they go through it, even if you are doing so from across the room while they are fully immersed.

> You may also feel, as you work deeply with the organ system and the disease, the pain the person is experiencing. It is important that you receive this pain, establish a relationship with it, and not turn away from it (or the person) because of the impact it makes or because you fear it.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 241)

  
....  
#### Fear is part of the process of facing the darkness

> it is always frightening to enter this fruitful darkness but that is no reason to stop, it is just part of the process—(Buhner, 2004, p. 242)

  
....  
#### Definition of communication regarding meaning

This connects with [[@beauchampIntroductionHumanCommunication2020]] definition of meaning

> Communication is a process of perceiving, interpreting, crafting, and directing meaning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 248)


### CHAPTER THIRTEEN --- THE IMPORTANCE OF RIGOROUS SELF-EXAMINATION AND THE NECESSITY FOR MORAL DEVELOPMENT




Once basic competence is developed in this capacity, the ongoing practice presents greater capacity for the development of skillful nuance in not only its applications, but what's available in and from it.  
  
(This feels like it connects to Tataryn's Looking Around from his four pillars of transformation)

> IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF DEVELOPING YOUR NATURAL CAPACITY for direct perception, the learning itself, the experience of the work, takes all the attention. But later, as with riding a bicycle, once you have experience with it you are not so concerned with keeping balance. The balance is, finally, automatic. You can begin to look around and enjoy the view. You know how to ride so well that you can do much more elegant things than merely going to the store. You begin to pay attention to riding in a different way. The riding itself, you find, gives you information about bicycles and balance and roads.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 258)

  
....  

#### By using this mode of cognition you come to know your heart-field in the way you may come to know the back of your hand

By using this mode of cognition (that which is required to perceive and engage the meaning of the world, including heart-perception) regularly, you come to know your heart-field in the way you may come to know the back of your hand.

> Your heart-field has an identity , something that is more than the sum of the parts. It has a particular shape, even though that shape is in constant flux. It has a particular feeling, even though that feeling is in constant flux. It has a specificity that you can know as well as you know your hands.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 258)

  
....  

#### The heart-Field as a 3-dimensional Mirror

Once we come to know this field well, it becomes like a 3 dimensional mirror wherein any disturbance within it cues that we are encountering something, and the alteration of that field becomes a reflection of the thing that is touching it.

> The heart-field   
> in some ways   
> is like a three-dimensional mirror,—(Buhner, 2004, p. 259)
....  
> The meanings from the world, from the particular thing you are perceiving, a plant for example, alter the fabric of this field. The particular alteration itself is a reflection, an image of the thing touching it.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 260)

  
....  
However, it what is reflected will often be of ourself, meaning that it may bring to mind things that are of you as the form of communication, especially old emotions or wounds.  
  
This can become confusing as it is easy to get caught up in ourselves and what is coming up for us. For example, get caught in transference when what was being called up were feelings/memories of our history with out father, when was is being communicated is doing so through those feelings, and is thus beneath and beyond our personal attachment to them.

> Unresolved emotional experiences, when activated, can move up from unconsciousness and affect our sight. Like a film across the surface of the eye, these experiences distort, alter, and shape what we see.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 263)
....  
> Thus when working with feeling as a sensory medium, you will have problems if you do not understand that activation of old emotional experiences is an integral part of the process.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 263)
.... 
> Personal histories are simply old experiences upon which the brain draws when assembling a gestalt of understanding. If you do not understand them and have not come to some sort of resolution with them, you will perceive them as real when they are simply a mode of representation.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 264)
  
....  

##### Meanings/Understandings take the shape of memories through participatory consciousness

This happens because in order to receive these messages we need to open ourselves up enough to effectively experience "participatory consciousness", wherein our experience is entangled with the consciousness of the other we are interacting with.  
  
Those what arises is of us and not of us. It is aspects of us that are brought up as a mode of representing something not of us. Thus we need to be committed to being careful, even skeptical of our responses to those modes of representation. It is those responses we need to be careful about, as we can get caught up in them in ways that prevent us from seeing any deeper than our responses. We lose the meaning because we are too wrapped up in our emotional response to the message.

> Thus, because you are so deeply perceiving meanings as a participatory consciousness, the process calls for a commitment to rigorous self examination. You trust your senses, your heart’s ability to perceive in this way, and yet simultaneously keep a healthy skepticism of your internal response to the mode of representation. The key word here is response.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 265)
....  
> You must gain a facility with understanding the responses you have to the modes of representation that arise within you, and learn to untangle their meaning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 266)

  
....  

##### Our practice of this kind of perception necessitates a commitment to self-inquiry and shadow work.  

This means that our practice of this kind of perceptions necessitates a commitment to self-inquiry and shadow work.  
  
Both because we need to be able to disentangle our responses from the meaning and thus need to be able to see and own the otherwise hidden/rejected aspect of ourselves. But also because this mode of perception itself will reveal our shadow.  
  
Thus we not only need the shadow work to do cultivate clarity in this perceptual skill, but the perceptual skill itself will trigger the shadow work.

> Each thread leads deep inside us, to a place in which we keep unexamined parts of ourselves.   Thus, obtaining clarity in this process necessitates a personal engagement with your hidden selves, with your personal demons, and with your shadow.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 267)

  
....  
This is what he called being able to see the secondary reflection. Wherein the first reflection (in the 3D pool) is that of the other we are being touched by, and the secondary reflection is the aspect of ourselves (or deep self, and even shadow) that is being revealed through the communication and through our responses to it.

> To see clearly, to “become a transparent eyeball,” you must learn to look below the surface of the reflection in your heart-field, to see the secondary reflection that comes from your deep self. And then to begin the work needed to come to terms with those hidden aspects of yourself, to heal them, to reincorporate them, to reintegrate the split off parts of yourself back into your Self.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 268)
....  
> To attain mastery of this work, you must be willing to see—and reincorporate—the shadow parts of yourself that you have hidden away.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 269)

  
....  

#### Robert Bly's "Long Bag" metaphor for the shadow, applied to the development of heart-perception

The following pages offer an excellent exploration of  [[@blyLongBagWe2012|Robert Bly's Long Bag Metaphor For The Shadow]] and its application in the development of heart-perception.  

> These shadow parts, the parts that others didn’t like, are perhaps hidden away in a little room with the key cleverly concealed or maybe, as Robert Bly says, we have stuffed them into a long bag we trail behind us.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 269)

#### Eating The Shadow as a metaphor of healthy shadow work 

Eating The Shadow is a metaphor of healthy shadow work, where arising of the shadow are taken in as nourishment.

> Eating shadow, eating the interior shut-up parts, stops your unconscious need to eat external interiors.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 275)

  
....  

#### The practice of heart-perception and the mode of cognition that is required to perceive and engage the meaning of the world changes us in a good way.  

The practice of heart-perception and the mode of cognition that is required to perceive and engage the meaning of the world changes us in a good way.  
  
This is because using it as a way of relating to/perceiving Nature asks us to do the shadow work of the shadows revealed through the light of Nature itself. Those asks, then, are like teachings and light that offers them is so full that it will continue to reveal all aspects of ourselves we have hidden away, are disconnected from.  
  
As such, it is as though we have been damaged by the the modern world in similar ways as natural habits are by human settlements, mining, etc. By doing this work we encounter teachings from Nature (from plants) that, when learned, amount to a kind of "personal ecological reclamation" within us.  

This reclamation is of our fracture selfs back to wholeness, like a fractured ecology back to the resilient diversity that existed prior to modern humanity's damage done to it.  

These teachings that allow for this personal ecological reclamation of our souls (for lack of better term) is the secret teachings of the plants.  
  

> This mode of cognition you are developing, your continual perception of meaning, stimulates of itself this internal ecological reclamation.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 276)
....  
> For when we enter the wildness of the world, begin perceiving with the heart, reading the text of the world, an energy from the world flows deep inside us.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 276)
....  
> Any place within you that is bent or twisted casts a shadow .—(Buhner, 2004, p. 276)
....  
> he world shines a light that reveals everything by the shadows that it casts. And these shadows, their shape and orientation, let you know in just what ways you are not straight within yourself.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 276)
....  
> In the light of the world, every part of you that is in the bag will eventually be revealed. And along with that light comes not only revelation, but also the teachings necessary for personal ecological reclamation to occur.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 276)

....  
This process of personal reclamation will never end. It only deepens over time,

> The process is a long one. Each year that you use this mode of cognition the more phenomena you will encounter , each of which will demand a greater clarity from you.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 277)

  
....  

This will create a kind of morality in us "in accordance with the deep truths that permeate all Nature." A morality that is lead by the Natural world and the systems that allow life to thrive within it (rather the through rules and impositions places upon us through human systems).  
  
Our sense of self will be changed by this, as our individuality becomes entangled with the Natural world through it led by the shadow work the teachings of Nature's light invites us to do.

> of necessity, you will find that a moral development occurs within you. The shaping that is happening to you, the continual demands that you know yourself, that you face the darkness within and without, begins to take on a moral dimension.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 278)  
....  
> And this rearrangement of your internal self is stimulated and directed from the world outside you. It does not come from a top-down hierarchy of values, but is a quality, a value, that emerges from within, from the center outwards, when your individuality is entangled with that of the world.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 278)
....  
> You are shaped by this interaction with the world in the way you are meant to be shaped. In your nonlinear, unprogrammed walking through the world, you find the things you need to find. T—(Buhner, 2004, p. 280)
.... 
> True morality begins to emerge of itself. The continual exchange of soul essence, of heart-field, of communications with the wildness of the world allows the wildness of the world, and its essential morality, to enter within.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 280)
....
> in accordance with the deep truths that permeate all Nature.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 284)  


This allows us to become the dynamic and multi-dimensional selves we truly are, but was otherwise forced into linearity through the wounds of the modern world.  
  
(in the many perspectives and expressions of the self kind of way, and not a new age multidimensional way).

> All people are in fact born multiple personalities. All people naturally should possess multiple points of view, have a multidimensional consciousness. The adoption of a linear, single-minded focus corrupts the self, forces us to forgo depth of self and to become one-dimensional. It forces parts into the bag by its very nature.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 282)

### CHAPTER FOURTEEN --  READING THE TEXT OF THE WORLD THE GEOGRAPHY OF MEANING AND THE MAKING OF THE SOUL


#### There is meaning in the world, encoded in all living things

There is meaning in the world, encoded in all living things. By entering a mode of cognition that allows for the direct perception of these meanings, we become intertwined with the life expressing that meaning. Through the act of perception, we link ourselves as observer to that observed.

> In making a book, human beings insert the meaning into the physical object. But in the wildness of the world, the meaning was inserted long before books and printing presses or even human beings existed.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 289)
> ...
> Our perception of the meanings in the phenomena around us connects us to those meanings; observer and observed become linked through the process of perception.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 289)

  
....  
#### Meaning is not found in the parts, but in the relationship of those parts in creation of a whole.

> As with the giraffe figure, the meaning in the sentence, “How are you doing?” is not in the sentence itself. It resides in how the parts combine, the tension between those parts, which parts are next to the other parts—(Buhner, 2004, p. 290)

  
....  
#### Meaning is primary, language is secondary

The development of human language is the result of learning to share the perception of meaning. The meaning was primary.  
  
> It is our capacity for perceiving meaning that is primary, not language.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 291)

#### All living things speak, even if we can't hear them

There is a language to the world, though, as all things have language in some way, and thus all living things speak (even if we can't hear them)
....  

> Each phenomenon that we experience is its own language. It speaks always whether or not we are listening, for we are not the primary objects of its affections.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 291)

  
....  
#### The brain (our analytical mind) performs a translation from the complex non-verbal interchange of communicating with the living world  
  
The brain (our analytical mind) performs a translation from the complex non-verbal interchange of communicating with the living world. This translation is important to our capacity to apply lessons present in that communication int our lives in a thoughtful way, but we must be careful not to become so disconnected from the direct experience that we begin to believe that the translation was the message. Because of this it is important to return to the non-verbal elements of the experiences. The QOAAR offered.

> We are engaged in communicating through a highly complex, nonverbal form of linguistics, of which our language is only a reflection. Our brains perform an act of translation. This puts salt on the tail of the experience, lets us use it in our daily lives. But this translation must be continually reconnected to the origin itself, otherwise it risks becoming a dead thing,—(Buhner, 2004, p. 291)

  
....  
#### Technological reality means living in simulation  

The meanings we encounter through technological images are not living meanings, but simulacrum of meaning.  
  
To have a life lived in relationship with the living world, we must return to where those living meanings are.  
  
**We have become so disconnected from the living world as it has slowly been replaced by the fantasy of screen media***

> Within the images that the technological world offers us, there are no living meanings, only the appearance of meanings. Scientific technology takes the image, reduces it into something that is not real, but still has the appearance of reality. We lose the imaginal for the merely imaginary.  
> television   
> We must continually reexperience the living images of the world, the plants, and all of creation or we ourselves risk becoming a pale reflection of life, a copy, a shadow.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 292)

  
....  
All things are aware and alive, and the deeper we go with our capacity to touch/be touched by the world through heart-perception, the more the communications we encounter with it become more than information, but the touch of beings upon us, through us, as us.

> And as we deepen our capacity for direct perception, we find that all things are aware, that all are looking at us, that all are communicating with us. And these communications of meaning go deep. They literally are communicative touches of living beings, much more than mere informational bits encoded within words.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 294)

  
....  

#### There is a capacity to get a general read of a natural landscape, like reading a room

There is a capacity to get a general read of a natural landscape, like reading a room, through this mode of cognition/perception.

> When you first begin extending your heart-field routinely and allow yourself to be sensitive to the chance encounters with meaning that always occur in wild landscapes, the meanings you come upon will, perhaps, strike you first as only general impressions.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 295)

  
....  

#### The land holds memory

[[The land holds memory and meaning|noted here]]

> For the historical events that have occurred before us remain in the land, interwoven with the soil, set in stone. A—(Buhner, 2004, p. 296)

  
....  

#### The deeper meaning in the land is a living sermon from Nature

Beyond the general read, there is a deeper meaning. A meaning that permeates the living world that, once we are open and capable of touching/being touched by become a kind of "living sermon, living teachings" that can re-shape our interiority in positive ways.   
  
The Earth is a living being within which deep lessons about being that we can align ourselves with, and thus become expressions of.

> In a sense, these deeper meanings are sermons. But living sermons, living teachings that are meant to inform and shape us.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 297)
....  
> And our lengthy contemplation of these “sermons” leads to a direct reshaping of our interior.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 298)
....  
> For the Earth is a living place of sacred teachings. It is not two-dimensional words on a page, not a static thing, but a living, ever-flowing communication of meaning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 298)

....  
###### These living sermons go beyond general and are specific to you, and reshaping you.  

Your heart field is unique, and it is as if it activates a meaning field that allows the threads of deeper meaning of the world that pertain to your to shine out brighter than other threads.  
  
You find the ones (lessons) specific to you, because you as a unique being are building a unique relationship with the living world, and those what comes to you will be personal. Not exclusive, but specific to you as a person and thus the re-forming that comes from it will be from the living sermons from the living inter-being of the living Earth meeting you and vice versa.  

These lessons are complex and require effort and attention to learn, perhaps over a very long time. But being able to return to the initial touch is important in order to keep it alive long enough to learn it (as discussed perviously)  
  

> and you will find, upon closer examination, that the teachings you encounter contain specific communications uniquely meant for you. That, in fact, they are teachings intended to re-form you.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 298)
....  
> When you go into Nature, you let the field of your heart lead, moving to those things that for some reason attract you.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 299)
....  
> And when you feel yourself touched by meaning, know that there is something important for you in this phenomenon that called you to it. Go to it and sit with it and strive to hear what is there for you.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 299)

  
....  
#### Nature's lessons are complex and may take years to learn.

Nature's lessons are complex and may take years to learn, perhaps even years for the lesson to be revealed. But, when we feel it touch us and we know in that moment it is important and meant for us, we must care for that lesson and both let ourselves learn and endeavour to learn that lesson however long it make take. 

> The lessons, like those in linear schools, are often complex. Many will take years to understand. You will know the importance of the lesson by the power of its touch upon you. There will be something in it that tells you here is a teaching especially meant for you. And so you must wrap it up carefully in your heart cloth, anchor in your experience the moment of first contact, and from time to time take it out again, unwrap and contemplate it. In your contemplation, many truths will emerge. Eventually , in time, with your ripening, the lesson itself will burst into understanding.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 300)

  
....  

#### This mode of cognition is not meant to be a method of extraction of information

We must remember that this mode of cognition is not meant to be a method of extraction of information, but way of being, a place within ourselves we can live and from that place a means to build relationship with the world.

> Ultimately, this mode of perception is not just a tool, it is a way of life, a mode of being. It is a world within which you are, and always were, meant to live. It ultimately becomes   if you wish it   an abode, not a place you visit from time to time.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 300)

  
....  

#### God and Nature are two sides of the same reality

God and Nature are two sides of the same reality, together the self-organized whole of life. Wherein religions may vary in many ways, they are also speaking to that same **something** that is the living whole greater than the sum of its parts.  
  
This is something we can learn to touch and be touched by as we learn the direct perception that allows in us the capacity to deepen our entangled meaningness with Nature/God.

> This entity can be directly felt, directly experienced. It has many names, but only one identity.   religions are a particular mode of representation they are not the thing itself   This identity is the center from which all things come. And it has always been clear to those who read the text of the world, who are open to the touch of life upon them, that this Mystery is so much greater than Man that it can never be understood with the linear mind. That before its presence we are very tiny indeed.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 301)

  
....  
#### Reading the text of the world  
  
Reading the text of the world is something like reading the geography of meanings in the various expressions of life such that threads of meaning that are of unique importance to you can be followed like sign posts along a path of learning in relationship with the living world.

> And once you enter fully into it, you will begin to see that there is a specific geography to it. Its signposts are not of the physical world, but are unique instead to this deeper dimensional world of meaning.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 302)
....  
> The shapes of mountains are transforms of communications, particular messages that the perceptive heart can understand.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 303)
  
....  

##### Qualitative Direction from the World

these sign posts give us direction, but it not direction in the sense of quantity (literal paths towards places of quantifiable distance) but of quality. Direction towards QOAAR, of states and ways of being within us. The distance of journey then, is not measures through the outside world but the internal one, how far we have come in ourselves.

> Some of these meanings have nothing to do with you, for you are not traveling in that direction, are not involved in that particular community of events. Others are teachings for you about the geography of meaning within which you find yourself. And still others are directional, pointing out the path you must take.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 303)
....  
> The quality of your interior world has changed, and you suddenly find you have traveled a greater distance. Even though you feel far from the luminous world as you do the work set before you, when you suddenly enter the world again, you find you have traveled a distance. You find you have traveled through qualities of distance, not quantities of it.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 304)

  
....  
#### The precious jewel of learning given to you by the world

> After you have done the work, after that burst of understanding comes, you have a jewel visible only to others who have gone this way before you, a jewel of great cost. That jewel contains a deep truth given to you from the heart of the world, one intended to bring you into yourself. And, as you understand these jewels, you weave them deep into your fabric. They literally become part of who you are. And so, in a sense, the map itself is woven into your structure at the deepest levels of your being. Simply in being yourself now, you know the way.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 305)

##### Be conscientious not to rush the learning that comes with this jewel

> This part of the learning is best not rushed. The contemplation should unfold in its own time. Each touch is filled with deep meaning, much deeper than can be perceived in a brief time. So, eventually, we learn to sit with them, to let them into us, to contemplate them.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 306)

  
....  

#### Be careful with "the tendency to be grandiose" about this journey you are on in yourself

Be careful with "the tendency to be grandiose" about this journey you are on in yourself. It is normal in the beginning, but eventually will be simply what you do. The carefulness is no to get your ego wrapped up in that early phase.

> There is a tendency to be grandiose about this journey in the beginning, perhaps for some time. But once you gain maturity with it, once you have remade yourself so that you can live in this world of living meanings for more extended periods, the grandiosity fades. It is simply what you do.—(Buhner, 2004, p. 306)
