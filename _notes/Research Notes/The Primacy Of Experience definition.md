The primacy of experience suggest that anything that we can experience is real. that we experienced it makes it real.  

Although, real does not necessarily mean existing independent of our mind's experince.  

Or, as Gallimore points out in [[@gallimoreRealitySwitchTechnologies2022]], real does not necessarily mean an adaptive assessment of external reality.

This quote from Dennis McKenna presents his definition:

> the primacy of experience. I posit that anything that we can experience is real. We know that it is real, because we experience it. That alone establishes it as real, and one could go a step further and assert that anything that is beyond the scope of experience, that cannot be experienced, may or may not be “real”—but we have no way of knowing because it is beyond experience.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 111](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=129&annotation=H2TH7SQ2))
