## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This paper is outline the relationship between prolactin and dopamine with respect to stress, and then presenting how b6 might help with treating Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia alongside traditional antipsychotics. However, I was only looking for information about b6 and prolactin, thus did not take notes on their proposals around Schizophrenia or Schizophrenia treament.

## Notes

#### B6 decreases prolactin through increase production of dopamine

> it has been suggested that it works for these conditions by promoting dopamine production in the brain, thus activating dopamine receptors that reduce the secretion of pituitary prolactinâ€”(Zhuo et al., 2021, p. 2)

.â€¦

#### D2 antagonism and the increase of prolactin

increased prolactin due to d2 antagonism decreases dopamineâ€™s capacity to hinder prolactin production through binding to d2

> Normally, dopamine binding to D2 receptors inhibits prolactin secretion from prolactin secreting cells. Thus, antagonism of D2 receptors results in increased secretion of prolactin (7, 46â€“51).

#### Prolactin as stress homone -- stress prolactin-dopamine hyptothesis

Unclear about this. Will make a tag for it though.

> The stress-prolactin-dopamine hypothesis is informed by observations indicating that prolactin itself can act as a stress hormone, being released in response to stressful stimulation. This stress-induced prolactin release may then trigger a positive feedback mechanism in which increased dopamine release triggers further prolactin elevation, while also potentially worsening psychotic symptomsâ€”(Zhuo et al., 2021, p. 8)

  
....  

#### Supplementing B6 can help with hypothalamic/pituitary dopaminergic neuron activity and reduce prolactin

It does this by increasing production of dopamine and thus increasing its capacity to reduce excessive production of prolactin in the pituitary gland through binding to the D2 receptors there.

> Supplemental vB6 can enhance hypothalamic/pituitary dopaminergic neuron activity, increase dopamine levels, and thus reduce competitive antipsychotic drug occupation of D2 receptors while enabling dopamine to inhibit secretion from prolactin cells (57, 58). In another study, vB6 was reported to inhibit prolactin secretion partially via a dopamine-independent mechanism (59â€“61). ARI is a partial D2 receptor agonist with effects that are often sufficient to maintain prolactin within physiological levels (62). Hence, based on the available evidence, it appears that vB6 influences prolactin levels via a mechanism or mechanisms different from that of ARI, such as enabling dopamine to inhibit prolactin hypersecretion and perhaps additionally via a dopamine-independent mechanism.â€”(Zhuo et al., 2021, p. 8)
