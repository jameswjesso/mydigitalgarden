### NOTES

##### POSITIVE RIGHT VS NEGATIVE RIGHT

*A positive right is something that the government is obligated to give you, e.g. health care, ambulance services, etc.  

A negative right is something that nobody need to provide us, but something that we are guaranteed not to have to have done do us, e.g. forced labour.  

Positive = certain things done for me  
Negative = certain things not done to me without my consent, unless there are "compelling reasons overriding this"*

> A positive right takes the form of something that the government is obligated to provide its citizens. This includes the right to an education, the right to unemployment or disability benefits, the right to police protection against crime, and so on. A negative right is something that nobody is obligated to provide us with, but which nobody may legally deny us without compelling reason. For example, the right to choose where we work and to refuse to undertake forced labour. In short, positive rights require that certain things be done for me, whilst negative rights require that certain things not be done to me, or at least, which are not to be done to me without my consent, unless there are compelling reasons for overriding this.

###### With respect to the shifting from it being illegal to kill yourself to it being heavily shamed and attributed to a lack of thinking capacity of the individual

> They are effectively reduced to the legal and moral status of children; because like children; they are restricted from being able to make decisions based on what they perceive to be their interests without the need to act covertly in order to avoid legal interventions aimed at frustrating their plans and imposing society’s will on them on the grounds that they are incapable of understanding their own interests and therefore society must act in their best interests, even when this will involve coercive interventions such as involuntary psychiatric holds, or even merely depriving them of access to an effective means of executing their will.

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 7)

##### The difference in arguments between anti-abortion and anti-suicide 

> Unlike anti-abortion advocates, suicide prevention advocates cannot argue that suicide must be restricted in order to protect an innocent victim. Therefore they instead need to insinuate that the suicidal person is themselves the victim of a decaying society that has become derelict in its duty of care to protecting the ‘vulnerable’.

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 7)

###### Why it is easier to delegitimize suicide through denying the mental stability and agency of the suicidal than by philosophical argument

In societies that hold individual rights and autonomy as paramount, the tactic of denying a person's right to kill themselves based on that person being in their right mind and the actions simply being against the moral or philosophical code of a particular society would likely prove to create significant pushback, as well as be antithetical to the proposed ethos of society. And thus the infantilizing. delegitimizing, and out right denial of mental capacity to make sound decisions on the basis of an illness of the mental function of anyone seeking suicide is used as the reason.

> It’s much harder to take away an adult’s right to be selfish, or their right to invest their welfare into a philosophical view of life that diverges from your own, than it is to take away the right of someone presumed to have the mental capacity of a child from acting against their own interests.

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 8)


##### Psychiatry fails people due to over reliance on scoring symptoms questionaries to diagnose ailments, rather than considering the whole person and the potential organic (life context) causes of their suffering, contrasted to other branches of medicine

*When you see a GP and report symptoms, they go through a process of gathering objective evidence (blood panels, medical imaging, etc) to gather evidence of a specific issue, and the organic cause of the one's ailments.  
  
*However, a psychiatrist will simply listen to you report your symptoms, and perhaps have you fill out a questionnaire  and then grade those questions based on decided averages, and then diagnose and medicate you. Often without any address or effort to observe the actual life circumstances that are generating the psychological suffering that is perhaps giving rise to that suffering.

> Psychiatry however, does not operate like any other branch of medicine (existentialgoof, 2022, p. 10)


> Whether or not you are diagnosed with a mental disorder will be determined by where your score sits in relation to a cut-off point that has been arbitrarily decided based on deviation from a normative standard, and will not take into consideration your life circumstances and personal history in order to determine whether or not your psychological disturbance might in fact be a natural and normal response to life experiences.

### Criticisms

##### This seems to be very focused on the rights over responsibilities.

*This is not an individual choice as this is an action that has substantial effects on others (the loved ones of the suiciding person).  

There are many nuances of this that would lean more or less towards the right to suicide in a particular instance, e.g. perhaps there is good reason to suspect that this person continuing to live would be a greater negative impact on their loved ones than them dying, or their loved ones are not able to see the suiciding person's reasons and are instead only thinking about themselves.  

But, as a general first response to the concept of suicide be an individual right of body autonomy, I believe this is a mistake based on the fallacy of separateness driven by the pathologically excessive-individualism of Dominant Culture.*

> Counter-intuitively, despite the fact that suicide (without qualifications regarding the health status of the individual concerned) is a matter of the bodily autonomy and negative of a single individual, making a choice exclusively with respect to their own body, it has failed to gain any meaningful political traction.

##### The argument made is its own version of the sloganism he is decrying while also being rooted in an a priori individualism and 

Again, this whole argument is based on the an a priori of the individuals ultimate locus as being within and of themselves alone. This is an absolute denial of the reality of interconnectedness, and I cant help but feel that this author is actively unable to see this and/or is denying it as to call it into consideration would jeopardize their entire argument   
  
(which seems personally driven to justify being able to kill themselves without feeling like that they are defective, wrong, or bad. Which, sure, is fair to not want to feel that way. Yet, the concluded strategy seems highly suspect to me. 

Although I do also agree that there is a certain degree of validity in criticizing answer like "suicide is never the answer" leading to absolutes on an issue that is extremely complex and nuanced. Again though, a more philosophically justified absolutism to "right to kill yourself because it's your life" doesn't seem much more valid, just more intellectual)

> For those who are in danger of losing a loved one to suicide; it is tempting to attribute their choice to a loss of agency. This allows friends and family of the suicidal individual to rationalise transgressions against the liberty of that individual which benefit the friends and family, on the grounds that intervention is also in the best interests of the suicidal individual themselves. This allows friends and family to have their cake and eat it too. Prevent the death of the sufferer without having to feel selfish for doing so.

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 12)

  
....  

##### The circular reasoning in his argument for right to die rooted in disconnection 

Interesting to consider this in the context of an augment for suicide being made on the basis of hyper-individualism. It is circular reasoning.  
  
"I feel isolated and worthless, and so I should be allowed to kill myself being I am an isolated island of autonomy and my life (and thus death) is not worth others being upset about and should not fought for"

> After all, feelings of worthlessness and isolation are two of the most significant drivers of suicidal behaviour.

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 13)

  
....  
##### Why a "year long wait" before getting unrestricted access to devices to kill yourself as a reasonable tactic for ensuring people  killing themselves are doing so in their right mind is not effective. 

_A year is not a long time, and if the person who wants to die would want to live if they had access to good mental health and/or healing experiences, simply having them need to wait an extra year does nothing to help support this._

> If the government wishes to ensure that people are not accessing these devices based on a momentary whim, then they can require that the suppliers of these machines implement a 1 year waiting period to ensure that the individual’s choice is stable over an extended period of time. Once the waiting period is complete; the government has no further legal recourse to cause any individual to be denied access, unless they can evidence that the individual has done something in the intervening period which would warrant having their autonomy suspended for a longer period of time.

....  


Life is a prison and forcing me to be alive is trapping me in this prison (paraphrasing) .... again, listening to the argument being made here only seems to reinforce that one of the very arguments he is criticizing: that suicidal individuals are not in their right mind.  
  
This whole article seems to be coming from a kind of construct of what life and reality is that is rooted in trauma and suffering as primary, and intellectually justifying a defensive strategy against that suffering. Yet, trauma and suffering is not primary, fundamentally, but a consequence of context, internal and external and thus the very foundation of his philosophical argument seems rooted in a fallacious worldview, rooted in trauma.  
  
I am not against some of his criticisms of psychiatry, legal structure, and trauma reactive ideology ideology and worldview. But he is suing these criticism to support his own trauma-reactive ideology and worldview, while claiming his is rational.

> f you persist in impeding my access to these willingly-provided services indefinitely, then this crosses the line into a clear violation of my negative liberty right not to be falsely imprisoned and enslaved;

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 18)

  
....  
##### When preventing a loved one's suicide becomes a selfish choice

_Here is one of the places I agree with him. However, like other points made throughout, the conclusion her draws form this point, although very intellectually justified, is as simple minded and un-nuanced as the the one he is criticizing

> However, there are also those who have lost loved ones who were suicidal over a period of years, and still believe that everything possible should have been done to ensure that they didn’t have easy access to effective suicide methods. To these people, I ask: how long would be too long to expect your loved one to have to wait before being granted the right to choose? How long would be long enough to have satisfied you that their decision was made with a settled mind, and based on their authentic interests? After how many failed treatments, in your view, does it become rational to lose hope that things will get better? If your answer is “never”, then I want you to consider that perhaps you are prioritising your own interests in keeping this person around, over their wellbeing.

(existentialgoof, 2022, p. 21)

  
....  
Yup, fair point. And yet, I still feel that the degree of simplistic response her has to these arguments falls short of perceiving the larger web of cause/effect that leads to the suffering that leads to desires to die and the societal institutions that both lead to it as well as those that fail to offer effective paths to healing. 

And a 1 year waiting person is a gross over simplification that would like cause as much ham as the forced suicide prevention he is arguing against.

> Without the legal right to access a safe and effective suicide method, life becomes a prison sentence. Has anyone else ever thought to themselves “I can’t live this way any more”...only to catch themselves and realise... “I not only can live this way. I have to live this way”.
