>[!Abstract]
> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability. Sequelae can include functional impairments and psychiatric syndromes such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Special Operations Forces (SOF) veterans (SOVs) may be at an elevated risk for these complications, leading some to seek underexplored treatment alternatives such as the oneirogen ibogaine, a plant-derived compound known to interact with multiple neurotransmitter systems that has been studied primarily as a treatment for substance use disorders. Ibogaine has been associated with instances of fatal cardiac arrhythmia, but coadministration of magnesium may mitigate this concern.
> 
>In the present study, we report a prospective observational study of the Magnesiumâ€“Ibogaine: the Stanford Traumatic Injury to the CNS protocol (MISTIC), provided together with complementary treatment modalities, in 30 male SOVs with predominantly mild TBI. We assessed changes in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule from baseline to immediately (primary outcome) and 1 month (secondary outcome) after treatment. Additional secondary outcomes included changes in PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5), depression (Montgomeryâ€“Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale) and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale). MISTIC resulted in significant improvements in functioning both immediately (Pcorrected < 0.001, Cohenâ€™s d = 0.74) and 1 month (Pcorrected < 0.001, d = 2.20) after treatment and in PTSD (Pcorrected < 0.001, d = 2.54), depression (Pcorrected < 0.001, d = 2.80) and anxiety (Pcorrected < 0.001, d = 2.13) at 1 month after treatment. There were no unexpected or serious adverse events. Controlled clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy are needed to validate these initial open-label findings.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This paper outlined research on the potentials of ibogaine (co-administered with IV magnesium for cardio protection) to treat long-standing TBI issues in veterans, including mental health and cognitive deficits. The results were substantially positive, and this shows the potential of this treatment (and perhaps ibogaine itself) to be an effective and directly treatment for TBI. 
> 
> The research was done at an established ibogaine clinic in Mexico (a centre called Ambio).

## Notes


#### Traumatic Brain injury is the leading cause of injury-related disability worldwide

> TBI is a leading cause of injury-related disability worldwide and is likely to remain so until at least 2030â€”(Cherian, p. 1)

....  

#### Ibogaine and noribogaine has affinity to several neurotransmitters

Ibogaine and noribogaine has affinity to several neurotransmitters, including NMDA, kappa and mu opioid, sigma 1 and 2, the nicotinic site of acetylcholine, SERT, Sat, and more.

>Pharmacologically, ibogaine and its principal metabolite noribogaine demonstrate moderate-to-weak affinity for a number of neurotransmitter receptors including N-methyl-d-aspartate, Îº and Î¼ opioid, Ïƒ-1 and Ïƒâˆ’2, nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin transporter and dopamine transporter, among othersâ€”(Cherian, p. 2)

....  

#### Ibogaine increases neurotrophic factors such as BDNF

Ibogaine increases the production of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and GDNF, and has neuroplastic effects (as seen in increases dendritogenesis. More info on BDNF and GDNF increases with ibogaine can be found [[@martonIbogaineAdministrationModifies2019|here]]

> Ibogaine also increases the transcription of neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor23 and increases cortical neuron dendritic arbor complexity in vitro2â€”(Cherian, p. 2)

....  

#### Ibogaine safety concerns for QT interval prolongation and why

Ibogaine poses a risk to physiological safety due it its effect on the heart. Specifically the prolongation of the QT interval, which in people with an irregular QT can cause the heart to stop. These events however seem to be results variables that can be managed safely with proper screening and supervisions. See quote below for causes.

> concerns related to neuro- and cardiotoxicity20,29. With regard to the former, only transient ataxia has been reported in humans20. In the case of the latter, however, lengthening of the time of ventricular depolarization and repolarization (Qâ€“T interval prolongation), with instances of subsequent fatal arrhythmia, has occurred29. ==High doses of ibogaine, pre-existing conditions, drugâ€“drug interactions and lack of vital sign monitoring may have played critical roles in these cases==2â€”(Cherian, p. 2)

....  

#### Magnesium supplementation reduces QT interval, preventing prolongation

Including magnesium with ibogaine treatment is proposed to reduce cardiac risk through its effect in preventing QT prolongation.

> Magnesium supplementation has been shown to reduce the Qâ€“T interval30 and magnesium can protect against Qâ€“T interval prolongation when coadministered with medications that ordinarily would have such an effect31, raising the possibility that its coadministration with ibogaine may offer cardioprotection and improved safety.â€”(Cherian, p. 2)

....  

#### TBI specific Cognitive battery shows marked improvements in cognitive function with ibogaine

According to their tests, TBI patients showed statistically significant improvement in processing speed, executive function, phonemic (verbal) fluency, and visual memory. These results remained after 1 month.

> To assess for any cognitive effects of MISTIC, particularly given the history of TBI in study participants, a neuropsychological battery was administered to participants at all three time points (see Table 3, Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2 for preâ€“post score comparisons). ==The results indicated statistically significant improvements in processing speed with large effect sizes (d = 0.97â€“1.34) and executive functioning (including inhibition, cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, phonemic fluency and working memory, with effects ranging from small to large: d = 0.31â€“1.22), both immediately post-MISTIC and at the 1-month follow-up.== Mean performances on these tests moved from the average to the high average score range relative to same-age peers and, in all but one instance, phonemic fluency was high average at baseline and improved to the superior range relative to same-age peers at the 1-month follow-up (d = 1.11). Learning and memory tests showed a significant improvement in visual memory at both time points and in verbal memory at the 1-month follow-up. Sustained attention showed a significant improvement in accuracy (detection) at both time points with large effect sizes (d = 0.86â€“1.05) and a weak but significant slowing of reaction time (d = 0.29â€“0.52), consistent with a prioritization of accuracy over speed and reduced impulsivity. No significant performance changes were observed in language (semantic fluency). No declines were noted across any performance domain.â€”(Cherian, p. 4)


>[!help] I wonder
> I wonder if the visual memory increases after ibogaine are related to hippocampus function, given [[@vossCloserLookHippocampus2017|the relationship between the hippocampus and visual behaviours related to memory]]. Perhaps, there might also be a relationship between cognitive deficits and neuro-ophthalmological impairments post-TBI.

....  

#### Ibogaine shows promise for TBI pharmacotherapy, field generally lacking

There is very little good evidence for drug therapies that help with TBI directly, and seemingly none that are a single drug therapy with high efficacy. Ibogaine seems to offer this, and by doing so help treat the various other symptoms (sequelae) of TBI as a consequence, e.g. depression, anxiety, etc.


> This is possibly the first study to report evidence for a single treatment with a drug that can improve chronic disability related to repeated TBI from combat/blast exposures. Moreover, there is no currently available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chronic sequelae of combat-related TBI. Current treatment options include cognitive rehabilitation, psychotherapy and medications that target specific symptoms, but there is limited evidence of efficacy52â€“54.â€”(Cherian, p. 4)

....  

#### The role of facilitation in results

There is evidence that ibogaine itself is helpful in resolving TBI symptoms, but the authors suspect that the facilitation context offered by Ambio played an important role as this study's results were higher than others, suggesting this potential.

> Similarly, the complementary therapeutic approaches available to SOVs during their stay in Mexico may have played a role in the therapeutic benefit that we observed, because other similar approaches with veterans67,68 have demonstrated benefits, albeit considerably smaller than those that we foundâ€”(Cherian, p. 5)

....  

#### Cognitive training does not work well for TBI recover, placebo

Evidence suggests that cognitive training for working memory, task switching, etc do not positively effect the deficits in these functions after TBI. Instead, it would seem that positive effects were a result of placebo given that they were dependent on prior expectation and in the positive group results were both weak and wore off quickly.

> Parong and colleagues72 found that providing positive compared with negative expectations led to significant but weak effects of cognitive training on working memory, task switching and nonverbal reasoning (and not on other cognitive domains that they tested). These effects did not survive a short delay, however, suggesting that any placebo effects are short-lived.â€”(Cherian, p. 5)

....  

#### Their Neuropsychological Testing (NPT) results are unlikely placebo, but maybe given it was not a RCT

The authors express the potential of the results being placebo given that the study was not a randomized control trial, and all people participated with advance knowledge and will for the symptom resolution.

> Importantly, the present study was not a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and participants elected to travel internationally for the treatment. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility that the therapeutic benefits were a result of expectancy rather than MISTIC.â€”(Cherian, p. 5)

They conclude, however, that although their NPT results were not measured against a control, are unlikely to be the results of placebo given the degree, consistency, and persistence of the measured improvements.

> In our study, NPT revealed either improvement or no change, with the former most notable for processing speed, phonemic fluency and attentional accuracy. Thus, although the present study was not controlled, it is unlikely that the observed large, persistent improvements on NPT are due to placebo alone.â€”(Cherian, p. 5)

....  

#### Their treatment protocol is likely effective even for old TBI (and non-veterans)

Based in their cohort being an average of 8 years since leaving the military, and their injuries occurred during their service time, the present research suggests that this treatment protocol 

> Considering that the average time since discharge from the military in our sample was nearly 8 years, these findings further suggest that MISTIC may be effective even when administered years after the injuries. Our results also raise the possibility that this therapy may be beneficial in other populations suffering from sequelae of repeated head traumaâ€”(Cherian, p. 7)

....  

#### No psychotherapy was offered, but there was ibogaine-specific facilitation 


> Of note, no psychotherapy occurred during treatment, but support was offered by monitoring personnel if needed. Otherwise, the treatment experience was completely self-guided and patients were spatially separated from each other and wearing eye shades. Integration activities occurred on day 4 and participants returned to the United States on the evening of day 5 to return to Stanford University for the next study visit.â€”(Cherian, p. 11)

....  

#### Subjects were fasting, Magnesium was intravenous, a GI protective agent was given.

> With subjects in the fasting state, as noted above, the Ambio clinic personnel administered an intravenous infusion of 1 g of magnesium sulfate and an oral gastrointestinal protective agent 1â€“2 h before treatmentâ€”(Cherian, p. 11)

....  

#### Secondary magnesium offered at 12h from ibogaine administration

> Approximately 12 h after administration of ibogaine, participants were administered an additional intravenous dose of magnesium sulfate, oral and intravenous antioxidants and metabolic supporting agents.â€”(Cherian, p. 11)
