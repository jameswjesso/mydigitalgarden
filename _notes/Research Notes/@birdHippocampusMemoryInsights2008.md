>[!Abstract]
> The hippocampus appears to be crucial for long-term episodic memory, yet its precise role remains elusive. Electrophysiological studies in rodents offer a useful starting point for developing models of hippocampal processing in the spatial domain. Here we review one such model that points to an essential role for the hippocampus in the construction of mental images. We explain how this neural-level mechanistic account addresses some of the current controversies in the field, such as the role of the hippocampus in imagery and short-term memory, and discuss its broader implications for the neural bases of episodic memory.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This paper explored the various theories around the hippocampus and its role in memory, where they succeed and where the fail. 
> 
> This was all in reference to presenting their theory, which they called the BBB theory (after their last names) which essentially presents that the predominant role the hippocampus plays in memory is in spatial processing and memory, and that the role the hippocampus plays in other forms of memory is related to this spatial processing. They present how this all works at the nueronal level through "place cells" in the hippocampus. That "hippocampal processing that is based on the spatial firing properÂ­ ties of hippocampal neurons". 
> 
> I found that this connected with the other paper I read on the bi-directional link the hippocampus plays with visual exploration behaviours, namely [[@vossCloserLookHippocampus2017]].

## Notes

#### Procedural Learning is the unconscious learning of a skill

Procedrual learning is skill learning, which can be actions or perceptual processes. This style of learning is not a matter of explicilt (declarative) memory.

> Procedural learning The unconscious learning of a skill, such as a series of actions or perceptual processing functions (for example, learning to ride a bike), which typically results in increased speed or accuracy with repetition.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 182)

#### Sematic memory is divorced from intial context, can be remembered without hippocampus

When we return to a memory many times, it loses the stimulus complexity of the intial context of that memory and becomes more like a kind of script. Something detached from sensory context, like a photograph rather than what that photograph was of. Because of this, it generally isn't comprimised by hippocampus damage due to it no longer needing the hippocampuses role in orienting aspects of the memory in the context that the memory happened within or the context the memory may be presently relevant to.

>[!quote] ...
> Thus, the memories of remote events that survive following hippocampal damage tend to be semantic in nature rather than episodic (that is, they are memories of stereotyped oft-repeated scripts rather than of flexibly re-experienced events). Insofar as the remote memories are episodic, they continue to depend on the hippocampus27.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 183)

#### Different types of memory and their related systems (image)

The image below outlines the various types of memory funtions within the two main memory systems, namely short- and long-term memory/

Short-term memory includes of phonological loop, visualspatial sketchpad, and neocortical sensory and motor buffers

Long-term is subdivided between declarative and non-declarative memory.
- declaritive memory (aka explicity memory) includes contextual/associative, episoditc, recollection; and non-contextual/non-asscociative semantic, familarity.
- non-declaritive (also call implicity memory) includes procedural, priming, and classical conditioning

#### Spatial memory hippocampus and place cells

Place cells are neurons that serve the specific function of creating a "place-field" which is a kind of resprention that allows for orienting our perception in space and time. Their function allows not only for a represention fo place, but also the processing of various self-movement stimuli from from our sensory apparatus as we move through space and time. They also map changes of the self's position in the place in the form of tracking the resulting changes in the placefield, and will then "re-map" to a new representional place-field after sufficent enough changes to that place.

>[!Quote] ...
> Place cells fire when an animal is at specific locaÂ­tions in an environment (the cellâ€™s â€˜place fieldâ€™) and, as the animal explores an open environment, the ensemble of cells provides a stable representation of the animalâ€™s location, independent of its orientation. Thus, placecell firing does not simply reflect direct sensory input;â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 184)
....   
> Place cells encode a â€˜sense of locationâ€™, as corÂ­roborated by a consistency between search locations and place-cell firingâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 184)
....  
> Besides responding to incoming perceptual informaÂ­tion, place cells are also driven by self-motion signals (proprioceptive, vestibular and reafferent signals from intended movements), which indicate the location of the animal on the basis of its own movements â€” a process referred to as â€˜path integrationâ€™.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 184)
> ....  
> they generalize across minor changes to the dimensions and features of an environment, allowing the animal to remain orientated. However, if a familiar environment is dramatically changed or gradually altered to become more similar to a different familiar environment, the place-cell representation will abruptly change (referred to as â€˜remappingâ€™) to signal that the animal is now in a different environment.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 184-185)

Because of this, place cells are imporant aspect of the hippocampus's spaital processing, learning, and memory function. Damage to the hippcampus can damage this function, result in the common symptoms of forgetting where things are and getting lost.

>[!Quote] ...
> Spatial memory problems, such as getting lost or forgetÂ­ting where objects have been placed, are a common conÂ­ sequence of hippocampal damage in humans. â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 184)

#### Role of place cells and hippocampus in mental images and memory


The place cells in the hippocampus allow for a represention of the envrionment of one's remembered experience like painting a scene in one's mind. This includes the location of the observer (self). The role of the place cells here is to contrain what is retreived such that it is "consistent" with the remembered envrionement.


>[!cite] ...
> When we think back to events that have occurred to us, we are often able to summon up a mental image of the event and play through some of the details. The BBB Model proposes a crucial role for the hippocampus in this ability, with place cells reactivating representations of the spatial geometry of the environment and the locations of objects in it. The geometric information, distances and bearings to extended environmental boundaries (for example, walls of buildings) are probably represented in the parahippocampal cortex67, whereas object informaÂ­ tion and featural information are probably represented in the perirhinal cortex68â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 185)
....  
> the full representaÂ­tion of a place, comprising the location of the observer as well as the location and appearance of the surrounding landmarks, can be retrieved following the presentation of a partial cue (for example, a single landmark) through the process of pattern completion. Place cells constrain the retrieval of information so that it is consistent with a parÂ­ ticular environment and with perception from a single specific location in that environment.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 185)
....  
> This constraint might be important considering the vast amount of inforÂ­mation that is accessible to memory and the potentially exponential number of ways in which this information could be combinedâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 185)

Interestingly, if one uses their imagination to move themselves within that environment, such that they alter the viewpoint of their original memory, the place cellsâ€”similar to how the opporatie in an external envrionementâ€”track that movement too, and constrain the imagined environement such that the simulated movement itself is remains consistent with the environement as well as constraining the represention to remain consistnet with the imagined enrionement.

>[!quote] ...
> What happens when you want to shift your viewpoint within a remembered scene? The BBB Model suggests that just as actual movement signals update the animalâ€™s sense of location in an environment, simulated moveÂ­ment signals that are generated in the prefrontal cortex might allow imagined shifts of view or position through processing in parietal or entorhinal cortices63. The hipÂ­pocampal place-cell representation would then constrain the imagined scene to ensure that it remains spatially coherent during motion and remains consistent with the imagined environment.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 185)

In this way, the hippocampus plays an important role in the spaital naviagation, and construction of mental images of rememberd places.

>[!quote]
> the hippocampus is necessary for the construction of a spatially coherent mental image of any remembered scene, including shifts in viewpoint that enable one to mentally play throughâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 185)

#### The hippocampus is involved in episodic and semantic memory through as the phenomenological experince of recollection is often spatial

Although semantic memory can exists without hippocampal involvement, that the hippocampus is essential for spatial processing and memory makes it also involved in episodic and semantic memory as the phenomenological experience of recollection is a kind of spatial experience, or scene. Thus, the processes that allow for episode and semantic memory to be encoded require hippocampus function.
(Specific to their model, BBB)


>[!quote] ...
> This aspect of retrieval, we argue, is not only hippocampus-dependent, but might also typify the phenomenological experience of recollectionâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 186)

Semantic memory, for example. Although... 
###### Semantic memory is divorced from original context

>[!Quote] ...
> Semantic memory is information that is divorced from the context in which it was acquired. Its retrieval does not require the construction of a mental scene, and is thus not likely to be hippocampus-dependentâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 187)
###### Hippocampus may still involved in semantic memory ...

Because the rehersal of that memory that would led to the learning that would make it a semantic memory may involved the kind of spatial processing that requires the hippocampus.
 >[!Quote] ...
> An extension of this interpretation is that the hippocampus might support the rehearsal of a learning event, which would enable the event to be incorporated into an extra-hippocampal semantic system.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 187)

....  

#### The hippocampus role in imagination and mental imagery


>[!Quote] ...
> An interesting aspect of this conceptualization of hipÂ­pocampal processing is that the imagined scene does not have to be a â€˜trueâ€™ memory. Rather, the hippocampus is proposed to be necessary for dynamic mental imaging of any spatial scene. Thus, contrary to characterizations of hippocampal function in terms of â€˜re-experienceâ€™ or â€˜mental time travelâ€™ within episodic memory, the hipÂ­ pocampus should be just as necessary for imagining novel environments as it is for reconstructing images of previously experienced onesâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 186)
> ....  
> A functional imaging study of this task in healthy adults showed that the hippocampus was activated during the period of imagination, and the same authors concluded from a recent review of the imaging literature that the brain regions that are involved in memory tasks that involve rich mental imagery (such as episode recall and route planning/wayfinding), including the hippocampus, were the same as those involved in imagination71 (see also REFS 64,70,82)â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 186-187)


....  
#### The hippocampus supports scene recognition through integration of the geometry and the location of things within it

I believe this connects with the relationship between of visual exploration and the hippocampus, and th guiding of the hippocampus to the tracking of relations of objects with a particular scene as discussed in [[@vossCloserLookHippocampus2017|A closer look at the hippocampus and memory]]

>[!Quote] ...
> According to the BBB Model, these findings reflect the ability of the hippocampus and surrounding areas to efficiently support scene recognition by capturing the spatial geometry of a scene and the location of the objects in itâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 188)

....  

#### The short term memory function of the hippocampus is to place things relationally within a scene

The short term memory function of the hippocampus is to place things within a scene brought their relational orient ion to each other, allowing there to be a capacity to build a scene in the minds eye that is no dependant of the egocentric view point from which it was initially experienced.

>[!Quote] ...
> Although patients with hippocampal damage were unimpaired at rememÂ­ bering the objects and the locations where the objects had been presented, they were impaired at remembering the objectâ€“location associations. The authors stressed that the key hippocampal impairment concerned processing the conjunctions of object identity and spatial location, rather than the retention interval â€” a finding that is consistent with impairments on â€˜object-in-placeâ€™ tasks in animal lesion studiesâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 190)
> 
...  
>
> As each object is presented, it can be added to a single coherent representation of the spatial layout, from which â€˜scenesâ€™ from a specific viewpoint can be generated. This allows more efficient storage of multiple objects and their locations than alternative, egocentric representations of location in the parietal cortex, and also explains the role of the hippocampus in tasks that require the retrieval of information from a new viewpointâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 190)

....  

#### The hippocampus is not only involved in spatial processing

>[!Quote] ...
> It is well established that hippocampal damage can impair performance on tasks that do not impose any overt spatial-processing demandsâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 190)

....  

#### The Relational Theory of hippocampal function -- the hippocampus as an organ of relational processing

The relational theory of hippocampal function suggests that its role is in assocation between things that are "perceptually and conceptually distinct" and in doing so allows for the transition and application of learned information between contexts, such that new representions and assumptions can be made about new contexts based on previous ones. In this theory, space is another aspect of the stimuli being recognized and encoded, and spatial processing amounts to an aspect of relational processing.

>[!Quote] ...
> It proposes that the hippocamÂ­pus is required for associating perceptually and conÂ­ceptually distinct items. By forming such associations, information that is learnt in one context can be flexibly expressed in another, and generalizations and inferÂ­ences about conjunctions of individual stimuli can be made. According to this theory, â€˜spaceâ€™ merely describes one way of organizing multiple stimuli, and spatial processing is only one example of relational processÂ­ingâ€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 190)
....  
> These models also suggest that the hippocampus mediates associations between spatially or temporally discontiguous events. They also provide a common explanation for the way in which, in humans, recollection of one word from a list tends to lead to the retrieval of the next few words, and for the way in which, in rats, the firing of some entorhinal cortical neurons reflects the recent pattern of the ratâ€™s movement132. Moreover, these models capÂ­ture the sequential nature of some aspects of episodic memory and link this to the neural mechanisms of spatial memory, retrieving sequences in the same way that a previously travelled route could be retrieved as a sequence of locations.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 191)
###### Hippocampus relational tracking?

It is possible that the hippocampus and its place cells can track much more than spatial aspects, but in non-spatial as well as objects of memory are always in relation with each other and new information that is present in perception

>[!Quote] ... 
> However, both the identification of hippocampal processing with subjective re-experience and our idenÂ­ tification of this with detailed dynamic imagery require further work, and it seems likely that the hippocampus does support aspects of memory that do not overtly rely on visuoâ€“spatial imagery. For example, memory for an event will include actions and knowledge speÂ­ cific to that event, which can be recollected without needing to imagine the entire scene. Can our approach be extended to such non-spatial aspects of episodic memory? One starting point might be the non-spatial factors that modulate the firing of hippocampal place cells, including aspects of the ratsâ€™ behaviour, as well as objects, odours137â€“141 and the passage of time135. At the very least, these findings suggest a combined encoding of locations with the content and temporal context of the events occurring there.â€”(Bird and Burgess, 2008, p. 191)
