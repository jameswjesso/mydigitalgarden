## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> An outline of MDMA's effect on prolactin levels in the body. It proposes that the increase in prolactin that results from MDMA is a secondary effect of it increasing serotonin.

## Notes


#### MDMA binding sites

The pharmacology of MDMA effects serotonin through binding to/activating the SERT gate, dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, as well as some other 5-HT sites, M1 and M1 muscarinic receptors, and the H1 histaminergic receptors

> In vitro studies have shown that S,R(+/âˆ’)-MDMA binds to or activates the serotonin transporter (SERT), the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 serotonergic receptors, Î±1, Î±2, and Î² noradrenergic receptors, M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors, and H1 histaminergic receptors (Battaglia et al, 1988).â€”(Murnane et al., 2012, p. 2)

#### MDMA increases the hormones oxytocin and prolactin

> In addition to eliciting secretion of the hormone oxytocin, S,R(+/âˆ’)-MDMA also elicits secretion of the hormone prolactin.â€”(Murnane et al., 2012, p. 2)

#### Drugs that increase dopamine reduce prolactin, drugs that increase serotonin increase prolactin

Whereas drugs that increase dopamine helps to reduce the excessive secretion of prolactin, drugs that increase serotonin increase prolactin secretion.

> Nevertheless, it is well known that drugs that increase extracellular levels of serotonin or are direct agonists of serotonin receptors elicit prolactin secretion; whereas, conversely, drugs that increase extracellular levels of dopamine or are direct agonists of dopamine receptors suppress prolactin secretionâ€”(Murnane et al., 2012, p. 2)

#### MDMA increases prolactin through its direct increasing of serotonin

> The major finding of this study is that S,R(+/âˆ’)-MDMA-elicited prolactin secretion is mediated by serotonin release whereas R(âˆ’)-MDMA-elicited prolactin secretion is mediated by serotonin release or direct agonism of 5-HT2A receptors.â€”(Murnane et al., 2012, p. 8)**
