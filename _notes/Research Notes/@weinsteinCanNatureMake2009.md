>[!Abstract]
> Four studies examined the effects of nature on valuing intrinsic and extrinsic aspirations. Intrinsic aspirations reflected prosocial and other-focused value orientations, and extrinsic aspirations predicted self-focused value orientations. Participants immersed in natural environments reported higher valuing of intrinsic aspirations and lower valuing of extrinsic aspirations, whereas those immersed in non-natural environments reported increased valuing of extrinsic aspirations and no change of intrinsic aspirations. Three studies explored experiences of nature relatedness and autonomy as underlying mechanisms of these effects, showing that nature immersion elicited these processes whereas non-nature immersion thwarted them and that they in turn predicted higher intrinsic and lower extrinsic aspirations. Studies 3 and 4 also extended the paradigm by testing these effects on generous decision making indicative of valuing intrinsic versus extrinsic aspirations.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> They presented immersion in nature as increasing intrinsic aspiration and decreasing immersion. Essentially, increasing our inclination to value inherently rewarding goals such as personal growth and community, vs goals related to wealth or fame. 
> 
> The also showed that immersion in non-nature environments (exclusively human-made environments) has no effect on intrinsic aspirations per se, but has an increasing effect on the value of extrinsic aspirations. 
> 
> This included our inclinations towards or away from generosity (nature increased, non-nature decreased), which event just the presence of plants in the room being enough to trigger the nature-informed inclination towards generosity.
> 
> They proposed this has to do with immersion in nature increasing our sense of autonomy and our nature relatedness. The overall proposal being that immersion in nature brings people closer together through increasing our valuing of that closeness, whereas immersion in non-nature as the opposite effect.

## Notes

### Value laden goals, life aspirations

Value-laden goals, also called life aspirations, are larger arc goals defining and defined by one's perceived values in life. These aspiration have a signifiant impact on the direction one's life takes through the way they inform perception and life decisions. 

>  Value-laden goals, referred to as life aspirations, influence important life decisions, define specific perceived values, and affect the direction and quality of life experiences. In a pervasive way, they shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors (Kasser, 2002â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,316)

....
### The experience of autonomy

The experience of autonomy is one that includes a sense of feeling connected with oneself, with a sense of personal empowerment that allows one to "author" themselves without being bent by the pressures of internal or external forces.

> Phenomenologically, autonomy is experienced as being in touch with oneself or having a sense of inner congruency and self-authorship, and freedom from external and internal pressures. â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,316)
  
....  
### Intrinsic vs extrinsic aspirations

Aspirations inform our goals.

Intrinsic aspirations are those that are primarily concerned with satisfying "basic psychological needs", such as community, personal growth, and intimacy. Essentially, internally valued things. Things that, in and of themselves, are inherently rewarding.

Extrinsic aspirations are essentially the opposite. They primarily concerned with things that have no inherently rewarding value, but are instead externally valued and are tend to be sought for the positive regard of others or for being rewarded by others in some way or another.

Both are about positive feelings within the self, however intrinsic aspiration tend to be more conducive to genuine wellbeing for, but also beyond, the individual as compared to extrinsic aspiration.. For example, intrinsic =  aspirations for relationships or community, vs extrinsic = aspirations for fame or wealth. 

The former focuses on bettering the individual in way that feed their relationships with others, the latter feeds off of relationships with others.

> Two general types of aspirations have been identified as being particularly informative: intrinsic and extrinsic life aspirations. Intrinsic aspirations concern the pursuit of goals that in themselves satisfy basic psychological needs (e.g., personal growth, intimacy, community). Extrinsic aspirations focus on externally valued goods that are not inherently rewarding but are sought to derive positive regard or rewards from others (e.g., money, image, fame). Kasser and Ryan (1996) posited that these two types of aspirations are qualitatively different and relate differently to well-being outcomes, which has now been shown in a number of studiesâ€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,316)

### Nature connection increases intrinsic aspirations through nature relatedness and autonomy.   

Their research revealed that greater nature connection is linked to increases in intrinsic aspirations, through it increasing our nature relatedness (trait) and our sense of autonomy.

> In the current article we suggest that psychological contact with, or phenomenal immersion in, nature contexts will facilitate valuing of more prosocial and less self-focused values and value-laden behaviors. That is, when people are in contact with natural scenes or living objects they will demonstrate a more intrinsic value set, orienting them to greater connection and a focus on others. In contrast, exposure to non-natural and artificial environments will elicit more extrinsic goalsâ€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,316)
...
> ==We suggest that nature influences the valuing of intrinsic and extrinsic aspirations by enhancing feelings of personal autonomy and increasing feelings of relatedness to nature==â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,316)

### Greater phenomenological immersion, contact, with nature increases intrinsic prosocial aspirations, and the converse increases self-focused extrinsic motivation
  
This was showed through a study where exposure to natural environments, vs human-made environments, resulted in participants rating intrinsic motivations higher in value and extrinsic as lower in value. 

Additionally, the opposite was also the case. Exposure to non-natural or exclusively human-made environments had no effect on intrinsic aspirations and actually increased their valuation of extrinsic motivations. 

> Study 1 showed that participants exposed to natural (as opposed to human-made) environments valued intrinsic aspirations and devalued extrinsic aspirations. As expected, the effect of exposure to natural versus human-made environments on change in intrinsic aspirations was moderated by level of immersion. Specifically, ==as individuals were more immersed in the slides presenting natural settings, they experienced greater increases in intrinsic aspirations. Immersion in non-nature scenes, on the other hand, led to valuing of extrinsic aspirations and devaluing of intrinsic ones==â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,320)

Their sense as to why this was the case had to do with participants rating themselves as having a higher sense of autonomy and relatedness to nature as a result of immersion/exposure to natural environments.

> Immersion interacted with condition such that after viewing a set of slides, those highly immersed in natural settings reported higher valuing of intrinsic aspirations and lower valuing of extrinsic aspirations. In contrast, when exposed to and immersed in non-nature scenes, participants espoused higher extrinsic aspirations and no change in intrinsic aspirations. ==Immersion also influenced the experiences of autonomy and nature relatedness after exposure to nature and non-nature contexts. Participants felt more autonomous and nature related as they were more immersed in nature contexts and less so as they were more immersed in non-nature contexts. Experiences of autonomy and nature relatedness fully mediated the effects on both intrinsic and extrinsic aspirations==â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,322)

### Nature immersion increases our generosity, detachment from nature increases greed

Nature immersion seemed to increase the likelihood of making generous decisions, and the opposite was also true where immersion in non nature environments increased greedy decision.  

> Nature and immersion also had a remarkable interacting effect predicting generous decision making indicative of higher valuing of intrinsic and devaluing of extrinsic values. ==As individuals were more immersed in nature slides, they were more likely to make generous decisions; as they were more immersed in non-nature slides, they were less generous and greedier==. These effects, as well, were mediated by the processes of autonomy and nature relatednessâ€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,324)

#### Having plants in a room is enough to increase generosity 

Having plants in a room is enough to increase generosity.  
  
This was shown in a study where people were given money and then given the chance to give that money to another, with the possibility to still getting more money but with the risk of losing it all vs keeping the money with no risk. 

> Participants who were immersed in a lab setting with plants present reported higher valuing of intrinsic aspirations, whereas non-nature contexts did not influence intrinsic aspirationsâ€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,326)
....  
> ==Immersion in a plant-filled lab enhanced generosity whereas immersion in a plant-devoid lab inhibited it==; these effects were mediated by autonomy and nature relatednessâ€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,326)

  
....  

### Immersion in nature brings people closer together -- immersion in non-nature alienates

Their proposal is that immersion in environments that are unrelated to human intervention or alteration has the result of bringing people together through that immersion increasing prosocial intrinsic motivations.

> Overall, these results are interesting because they suggest that nature, which is inherently unrelated to human intervention, brings individuals closer to others, whereas human made environments orient goals toward more selfish or self-interested ends.â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,327)

Further, that opposite is also the case. That immersion in non-nature environments results in alterations of values towards increased extrinsic, self-focused, aspirations, which in turn has a self-alienating effect on people. 

> The result that immersion in non-nature settings thwarted experiences of relatedness and autonomy is interesting and consistent with speculations that living in modern, non-nature environments may have a powerful isolating and/or self-alienating effect on people (Frantz et al., 2005; Vining et al., 2008).â€”(Weinstein et al., 2009, pp. 1,327)
