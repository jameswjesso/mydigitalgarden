#### Audience Capture is...

Audience Capture is when the person producing for the audience is subconsciously moulded by the expectations of that audience into becoming a caricature of themselves in service of those audience expectations and subsequent approval.  

This is not only an alteration of public persona to meet audience demand but "the gradual and unwitting replacement of a person's identity with one custom-made for the audience."

*The influencer is actually the influenced.*

This can escalate into dramatic, even grotesque, results.

#### We are shaped by our relationships

Audience capture is linked to how our personhood is not something inevitable about being born, but the consequence of becoming people for the people whose attention, acknowledgement, and wellbeing (in the sense of not harming them with our behaviour) are meaningful to us. 

This is connected to something called ["The looking glass self" by Charles Cooley](https://lesley.edu/article/perception-is-reality-the-looking-glass-self), wherein people base their sense of self on how they perceive others view them. 

#### The Looking Glass Self

The looking glass self ties into a number of observes effects of people altering their sense of self and behaviours in response to different social circumstances, e.g. Â [spotlight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_effect), Â [watching-eye effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watching-eye_effect), and [Proteus effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_effect)..  

The effect that called me the most was the Michelangelo phenomenon, which is a "semi-conscious cycle of refinement and feedback whereby lovers who genuinely care what each other think gradually grow closer to their partner's original ideal of them." This is similar to what John Vervaeke was speaking to in his podcast with Jordan Peterson when he said...

> "Like how you love someone in a committed long-term relationship because you indwell them and internalize them and they indwell you and internalize you.  
> ...  
>   
> For me, to love my partner is to cultivate that kind of receptivity. A space in which she can be within me. And I don't mean in any purely romantic metaphorical sense. What I mean is she finds a purchase in me whereby she can realize herself, in both senses of the word realize--Something that's coming into my awareness with intelligibility and something that's being actualized into reality. - -  
>   
> And she can come to trust that space, that that place of realization will always be available for her. And that she can come to rely on it. A place through which she can transcend herself when she needs to. And being committed to that and finding that inseparably bound up with my own project of trying to realize who I am.  
>   
> That's for me, the core of what it is to love somebody."
  
The author also suggests that being that our social system is such that we are not living in tight nit tribal-type communities where we have an intimate relationship with the majority of the people around us, but that we live in a variety of degrees of connection, the looking glass self that we develop is not primarily driven by something as benevolent and positive as the Michelangelo phenomenon. 

#### Humans are not born, but made

This ties in for me how [[Stephen Jenkinson]] speaks to humans are not born, but made. And the making of humans is a sacred process emerging out of the ceremony and village-mindedness of real human cultures (unlike what he calls the monoculture and unculture of with "dominant culture of North America"). 

This further connections with [[Darcia Narvaez]] and her work with [[The Evolved Nest]] and how when our fundamental social-neurobiological needs are met in early childhood, and live in a culture of people who have also had those needs met, we live in peaceful, cooperative companionship with each other, which was how humans were for 95% of their existence. This history is in contrast to where we are not presently as a species, as a consequence of that same unculture Jenkinsons speaks about, where our unmet needs leave us in cycles of competitive detachment with each other.

Personally, I see where we are now, and all that comes of it, as an expression of who we are when we have lost our humanity as a consequence of not having that humanity nourished by having our fundamental social-neurobiological needs met. 

#### Audience capture is when the looking glass self is shaped by strangers calling for entertainment and satisfaction

Back to Audience Capture, this looking glass self emerges as a consequence of strangers calling to be entertained.

He writes

> "When influencers are analyzing audience feedback, they often find that their more outlandish behavior receives the most attention and approval, which leads them to recalibrate their personalities according to far more extreme social cues than those they'd receive in real life. In doing this they exaggerate the more idiosyncratic facets of their personalities, becoming crude caricatures of themselves.Â 
> 
> The caricature quickly becomes the influencer's distinct brand, and all subsequent attempts by the influencer to remain on-brand and fulfill audience expectations require them to act like the caricature. As the caricature becomes more familiar than the person, both to the audience and to the influencer, it comes to be regarded by both as the only honest expression of the influencer, so that any deviation from it soon looks and feels inauthentic. **At that point the persona has eclipsed the person, and the audience has captured the influencer."** Emphasis mine


...

#### Radicalization through audience capture

He also goes on to ties into the radicalization of political agents in service of audience approval and/or votes, which, of course, ties into [[@orlowski-yangSocialDilemma]] and how the algorithms of social media are polarizing us and [turning us into/keeping us as reactive children](http://jameswjesso.com//social-media-destroyed-my-attention-and-altered-my-reality/)
