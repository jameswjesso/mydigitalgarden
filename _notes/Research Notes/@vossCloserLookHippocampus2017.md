>[!Abstract]
> Current interpretations of hippocampal memory function are blind to the fact that viewing behaviors are pervasive and complicate the relationships among perception, behavior, memory, and brain activity. For example, hippocampal activity and associative memory demands increase with stimulus complexity. Stimulus complexity also strongly modulates viewing. Associative processing and viewing thus are often confounded, rendering interpretation of hippocampal activity ambiguous. Similar considerations challenge many accounts of hippocampal function. To explain relationships between memory and viewing, we propose that the hippocampus supports online memory demands needed to guide visual exploration. Hippocampus thus orchestrates memory-guided exploration that unfolds over time to build coherent memories. This new perspective on hippocampal function harmonizes with the fact that memory formation and exploratory viewing are tightly intertwined.

## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This paper is presenting the involvement of viewing behaviour with memory formation and hippocampus activation, but predominantly from the perspective of why memory research has failed to consider the connection between visual exploration and memory in its experiements, how and why it may do so, and the potential challenges of doing so.
> 
> The key takeaway for me is that there is an important bi-direction conneciton between visual exploration, memory formation, and hippocampus activation, suggesting an important role in how the hippocampus both maps connections between aspects of envrionmental complexity and directs exploration of that envrionement (be it an external environement or internal environement, e.g. emotional or conceputal.) 
> 
> This takeaway also links to considerations on psilocybin and other psychedelics and their impact on hippocampal function and nuerogenesis, as well as the connection between damaged memory function and Neuro-ophthalmological dysfunction post TBI.

## Notes

#### Episodic memory is the binding together of various stimuli into a stored represention -- visual sitmuli is key

Episodic memory is the binding together of various stimuli into stored  representation, and visual stimuli (and thus visual exploration) is a key part of this process as humans are predominately visual in our perceptual orientation.

>[!quote]
> Episodes of experience unfold over time and are comprised of various interrelated stimuli. Episodic memory requires binding together these stimuli and their spatial, temporal, and conceptual relationships to form coherent memory representations—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 1)
>...
> The majority of our perceptual experience is visual—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 1)
> ...
> viewing behavior is an integral part of the memory formation process supported by the hippocampus—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 5)
  
....  

#### Visual exploration is a key part of memory formation -- memory formation is ongoing

Visual exploration is a key part of memory formation, which is an ongoing process further led by visual exploration that is itself guided by memory.

>[!quote] 
> visual exploration is itself a memory-formation process and is essentially linked to hippocampal function. In the framework we propose, memory formation is not a static event, but rather an active process that is shaped by the way in which memory is used to guide ongoing exploration.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 2)

....  

#### The hippocampus plays a critical role in this memory-exploration dynamic process/processes.

>[!quote]
> the hippocampus is a critical participant in the bi-directional interaction of memory and exploration processes that are iteratively engaged over the course of learning in order to build episodic memories.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 2)
>...
> “Activation of the hippocampal formation... is dependent upon the type and complexity of the information presented in the stimuli being encoded” [8]—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 2)

  
....  


#### Hippocampus activity is greater in memory exercises for items with greater complexity

fMRI memory experiments have shown that hippocampus activity is more seen in efforts to memorize things with greater complexity than simplistic thing. E.g. pairs and scenes vs single objects.

>[!quote]
> fMRI subsequent memory effects in the hippocampus are greater when complex graphical information is used as memoranda (pairs of objects and scenes) compared to more simplistic graphical information (single objects), which yields greater subsequent memory effects than words [9].—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 3)

  
....  
#### There is a relationship between the degree of visual exploration and the complexity of what is being visually explored and the degree of successful memory formation.  

There is a relationship between the degree of visual exploration and the complexity of what is being visually explored and the degree of successful memory formation.  

They present that this is part of why single words or objects, which equate to a fixed focal point, have lower fMRI subsequent memory effects than scenes or pairings of words as the latter provides greater complexity to be visually explored.

>[!quote]
> Exploratory viewing is a strong predictor of successful memory formation especially for complex stimuli. For example, memory performance is improved when subjects freely view face stimuli compared to when they maintain central fixation, demonstrating the memory enhancing effect of exploratory viewing [10]. Furthermore, heightened visual exploration enhances memory encoding for scenes and complex material [11–14]. Complex visual stimuli afford the possibility of substantial exploration differences between the later remembered and later-forgotten conditions, but these differences could even occur for relatively simple stimuli such as words, which are visually explored—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 3)
....  

#### Cognitive variables that influence memory through influencing visual exploration behaviours (their hypothesis)

There is evidence that there are cognitive variables that impact memory formation, such as attention, intention, and emotional state.  
  
But, the authors present that although we can interpret this as "states of mind" impacting memory formation, we can also see this as how cognitive variables may be influencing viewing behaviour, and it is that visual exploration behaviour that is having impact on memory.

>[!quote] 
>Essentially the same reasoning applies to many fMRI studies that attempt to characterize how memory is affected by various cognitive variables, such as attention, emotion, intentionality, and many others (Box 2). This is because the experimental conditions used to manipulate these cognitive variables can strongly influence viewing behavior, and so the cognitive variables of interest are often confounded with viewing behavior. Although it is tempting to interpret the effects of various cognitive manipulations on memory as reflecting how “states of mind” can influence memory, it would be equally fitting to consider many of these cognitive variables as creating “states of viewing behavior” that influence memory.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 3)
  
....  

>[! Question] Is the exploration of conceptual material related to visual exploration?
>I am wondering about the "visual" exploration of conceptual material within one's mind. Specifically I am thinking about vision therapy and my experience with concussion where I was unable to see concepts in my mind with my eyes open at the same time.

....  
#### Viewing behaviours are also involved in memory retrieval  
  
This connects with my previous note about my concussion experience where I couldn't "see" conceptual material in my mind enough to speak about it without closing my eyes to prevent their processing of external visual stimuli. My brain could not process both simultaneously.

>[!quote]
> Although we have focused on memory formation, the same logic applies to memory retrieval. Viewing behavior differs for categories of retrieval such as novelty, familiarity, and recollection [16–18][19]. Viewing behavior can signal memory processing even during free recall tasks when no stimuli are present to view [20], and can reflect complex qualities of memory such as temporal order [21] and competition among memories—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 3)

  
....  
### Lesions on the hippocampus have an impact on both memory and viewing behaviour

If lesions on the hippocampus have an impact on both memory and viewing behaviour. Can damaging to viewing behaviour have an impact on memory, then?  

>[!quote]
> individuals with hippocampal lesions demonstrate abnormal viewing behaviors, and the extent to which their memory impairments are secondary to viewing abnormality requires careful analysis of viewing behavior.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 4)

  
....  

#### Viewing behaviour alone is not a clear measurement for memory

Viewing behaviour alone is not a clear measurement for memory, as there are a number of viewing behaviours that increased hippocampus activity that are not related to memory formations.

>[!quote]
> Simply measuring viewing behavior is not by itself sufficient for unambiguously distinguishing activity related to memory versus viewing behavior.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 4)

  
....  
#### There was greater hippocampus activation when participants were viewing "geometrically impossible configurations" relative to possible ones.  

There was greater hippocampus activation when participants were viewing "geometrically impossible configurations" relative to possible ones.  
  
I wonder if there is a connection here between the complex and sometimes impossible in 3D space visual stimuli of psychedelic visuals and impact on hippocampus activity, and perhaps through memory, and thus meaning. (Preliminary look just reveals that DMT increases neurogenesis in the hippocampus, I know psilocybin does as well.

>[!quote]
> a recent study found that hippocampal activity increased for scenes containing geometrically impossible configurations of objects relative to scenes with geometrically possible configurations, leading to the conclusion that the hippocampus is critical for binding together novel object configurations—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 4)

  

....  

#### There is greater hippocampal and viewing activity when confronted with new faces, rather than familiar faces

There is greater hippocampal and viewing activity when confronted with new faces, rather than familiar faces, which suggest a connection between viewing behaviours and memory formation when it comes to learning new faces.

>[!quote]
> Human hippocampal activity measured with fMRI has been found to correlate across memory-formation trials with the number of visual fixations made per trial [38]. Furthermore, this relationship between hippocampal activity and viewing was present for novel faces, but not repeated faces, suggesting that hippocampal activity reflected the role of viewing behavior in memory formation.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 5)

....  

#### Memory signals from hippocampus direct visual exploration behaviours -- this is bi-directional, too

They propose that the visual exploration associated with hippocampal activation and learning is the result of memory signals from the hippocampus directing visual exploration. Thus, that exploration is strategically led by prior memories ("very short-term relational memory") towards further learning.

>[!quote]
> we propose an active-memory role for the hippocampus, whereby it provides memory signals that direct the exploratory viewing process that occurs during learning (Figure 2, Key Figure). We thus suggest that memory formation is an active and ongoing process that is shaped by exploration that is strategically implemented based hippocampaldependent memory signals.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 5)
> ...
> exploratory viewing is an integral part of the hippocampal-dependent memory formation process, rather than a mere by-product. Our position is that the hippocampus is responsible for providing access to very short-term relational memory signals that are needed for effective visual exploration.—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 6)

  
....  

#### The hippocampus and the tracking of relations as key to memory formation and visual exploration behaviours

The hippocampus is involved with the memory of the connections between aspects and "features of complex stimuli and/or episodes, as it holds the memory of those relations it also sends signals to influence visual exploration to further add to the robustness of awareness of other further relationships between features/aspects to better construct the overall memory of something through the reinforcing of the memory of its connections. (Especially when it comes to episodic memory)  
  
This is also bi-directional, as in visual stimuli triggers the online memory representation that cues for further exploration, which triggers both learning and further associations in the hippocampus which cues for further exploration.  
  
This would be why is it more active in complex scenes than more simplistic ones. There are more connections/relations to note.  
  
#### The hippocampus guides perception and exploration by and towards comprehending relations between perceptual elements

>[!quote]
> the notion that hippocampus supports online memory representation particularly of the relations among the features of complex stimuli and/or episodes [51]. By providing an ongoing memory for the relationships among the stimuli comprising an episode, the hippocampus could thereby yield the signals needed to guide exploration in a manner that fosters a comprehensive memory of all relevant relationships (e.g., revisiting weakly linked stimuli to allow further encoding of their relationships). Thus, the contribution of hippocampal online memory representation to exploration could be particularly suited to the construction of episodic memories with high cohesiveness among constituent parts—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 6)

  
....  

>[!quote]
> Other self-generated exploratory behaviors that enhance learning in the rodent (i.e., rearing) have been independently associated with increased hippocampal activity [60]—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 7)

  
....  
#### Viewing behaviours are linked to broad scale memory function

Viewing behaviour, which are of course connected with neurological and functional visual capacity, is connected with memory broad scale.  
  
The compromising of one could compromise the other. The connects for me with concussion and the potentials of vision-therapy.

>[!quote]
> The fact that viewing behavior is so highly correlated with key variables that affect memory suggests that viewing is highly relevant to memory function across a wide spectrum of circumstances—(Voss et al., 2017, p. 8)
