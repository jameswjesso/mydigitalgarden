## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> He is presenting an upcoming inflection point for the forced creation of a digital identity due to the social destabilization coming through ai and why proactively setting up and supporting a decentralized means for that digital identity will help us avoid a dystopian future.

## Notes


#### The difference between self and identity  

Self is who you are as an expression of life that is you as an unique being in the world.  
  
Identity is who you are, as defined and confined by what is expected and asked of you by various social institutions and contexts. Like a functional interface between you and the institutions themselves. (not the people of that institution

> a distinction between “self” and “identity”. Your self is who you are in a fundamental sense. Your soul. It is both the subject and object of your real, human, intimate, relationships. Your “identity” is who you are in a social, formal, institutional sense. It is an abstraction by which you come into relationship with societal institutions: social, cultural, political, economic, legal.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 1)

....  

> Your bank can’t come into intimate relationships with your self. It can’t get to know you and befriend you. Nor can your school or hospital or election office. The *people* at the bank and the school can, but not the institutions themselves. Instead, they “connect” with your identity by means of some set of processes and statuses or rights.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 1)

  
....  

#### The move towards a singular digital identity

There is a move in society, led by tech industry, to increasingly move towards a comprehensive and singular digital identity that interlinks the identity that interfaces you with tech marketplace products and services (built by the data gather through your engagement with those services) with that which interfaces you with various social institutions (build through your unique biometrics and institutional engagement history) into a singular digital identity.

> Those of us who have studied the digital have known more or less from the beginning that a day would come when the many different forms of identity that emerged in the analog social environment (e.g., SSN, birth certificate, credit card, drivers license, etc.) would ultimately be converged toward a foundational digital identity.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 2)

....  

#### AI technology's compromising of reality will force the creation of a digital identity, which will inevitably result in social credit system

He seems to be proposing will be an en masse move towards a singular digital identity and likely social credit system that will be interconnected with a verification system that will be managed by the government that will function to determine was is and isn't real as a response to the destabilization of both reality and who's who doing what due to explosion of AI technology, because if we don't society will not function effectively. This is an aspect of the meta crisis

> identity is the commanding heights of social power. Your identity is the means by which you access the resources of the institutional world. Have your identity stolen, and you’ll understand exactly what I’m talking about. As that identity goes digital, more and more of your life will flow through it and all of this will become data for “the algorithm”.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 3)

....  

> It is not a question, for example, of whether our social future will be influenced by some kind of social credit system. This is as inevitable a consequence of digital identity as spam is a consequence of email or political parties are a consequence of democratic process. The question is the governance and architecture of that power. There are some futures of digital identity that are technofascist dystopias. But there are others that present quite a different, better, possibility.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 3)

....  

> Our existing sensemaking systems, built almost entirely in and for an analog environment, simply aren’t up to this threat. Moreover, in the context of our local culture wars and the larger geopolitical unipolar/multipolar struggle, there is already a tremendous amount of effort put towards controlling the frame, shaping the narrative and winning memetic / network wars. All in, as John says, we may find ourselves in downward spiral, losing access to any grasp of “what is real” beyond the reach of our physical environment.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 4)

  
.... 

#### The Solution to AI's compromising of reality, and how it all adds up to the creation of a centralized digital identity.

> The solution to the AI problem grounds out in three specific capabilities: 
> 
> 1. We must be able to reliably distinguish between an authentic human and a bot. 
> 2. We must be able to reliably trace each and every piece of content to a specific point of origin (this is called “provenance”). For example, we must be able to be certain that a given video was created by some particular creator (human or otherwise) and has not been modified
> 3. We must be able to durably attach trust and permissions to virtual/digital identities that provably are tied to the same real identity over time. For example, if I trust you, I have to be certain that the next time I interact with the identity that I associate with you, that it really is still you (i.e., it hasn’t been stolen or sold). In other words, the solution to the problem of AI deep fakes is digital identity.

#### The 3 possible control schemes for digital identity

Between the three possible ways in which this digital identity will be forged and managed, and a decentralized one (e.g. through a kind of blockchain technology) is the one that is least likely to produce a dystopian outcome.

> There are three kinds of groups that are currently in a position to make a run at this. 
> 1. The State 
> 2. A handful of tech Oligarchs. 
> 3. A decentralized grass roots movement grounded in the blockchain.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 5)

...

> A centralized system intrinsically concentrates power.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 6)

....  

> This is what happened with Web 2.0, and we all know how that turned out. If digital identity follows in the footsteps of Web 2.0, this is a path towards the dystopian future. By contrast, a properly designed decentralized system intrinsically distributes the power of digital identity to the people and provides a path to a much more optimistic future.—(deepcode, 2023, p. 6)
  
....  


#### The design requirements for a proper solution to a decentralized digital identity


> Design Requirements 
> 
> Complete ownership and control of both data and permissions must be held by individuals themselves. In particular, it must be impossible, in principle, for the “governance mechanism” of the system to give your data to anyone without your permission. 
> Neither greed nor coercion can force the system to divulge information. 
> Highly compartmentalized and decentralized data storage so that no attack can access any meaningful data. It should be a hyperstructure, not an application. 
> An open service that many/any application can use but not tied to any specific application or any single blockchain. 
> Transparent and open. A
> ll of the above must be auditable by anyone who cares to do so.
