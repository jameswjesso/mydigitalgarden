>[!Abstract]
> Numerous scholars have explored the notion that our relationship is essential to our well-being, and some have suggested that we have an evolved inclination to affiliate with nature. A substantial body of research supports these hypotheses, and demonstrates both the restorative and additive capacity of affiliating with nature. This paper posits that experiences with the natural environment play a fundamentally important role in addressing the six existential anxieties of identity, happiness, isolation, meaning in life, freedom, and death--a perspective that we call Eco-Existential Positive Psychology. Moreover, we propose that affiliating with nature affords us the opportunity to be fully flourishing human beings. This paper provides supporting evidence for Eco-Existential Positive Psychology via an interdisciplinary literature review.

## Personal Summary

## Notes

### Existential Positive Psychology (EPP) is the study of how we can face the darkness of human experience

Existential Positive Psychology is the study of how we can face the darkness of human experience; the exploration of the 6 existential anxieties and what inherent strengths we can cultivate in ourselves to face them in ways that allow us to flourish in life.

Its major focus is about the quest for meaning and purpose; our needs for relationship and community; how we address the conflict between our anxious call to freedom and the judicious caring for our responsibilities; and how we react to death impacts how we live, and where spirituality, meaning, and the narrative we have for our lives influences our death anxiety.

#### The 6 Existential Anxieties

The 6 Existential Anxieties are 

- Identity
- happiness
- isolation
- meaning in life
- freedom
- death

> Existential Positive Psychology merges Existential Psychologyâ€™s focus on the darker realities of human existence such as meaninglessness, alienation, and death and its phenomenological analysis, with Positive Psychologyâ€™s brighter focus on human strengths and well-being and its emphasis on scientific methodologies. It proposes an expanded vision of Positive Psychology, one that recognizes that addressing all six types of existential anxieties is necessary for human flourishing.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 371)

### Eco-Existential Positive Psychology addresses the 6 existential anxieties through Nature

The premise of Eco-Existential Positive Psychology (Eco-EPP) is to explore how the 6 existential anxieties can be addressed through our relationship and engagement with the natural world, to the result of bettering our personal lives and our society writ large due to the positive impact it would have on the overall web of our relationships.


> Eco-Existential Positive Psychology positions the cultivation of our biophilic tendency to affiliate with nature as innately suited to addressing the existential anxieties concerning identity, happiness, meaning in life, isolation, freedom, and death. Moreover, we believe that affiliating with nature affords us the opportunity to be fully flourishing human beingsâ€”which in turn will allow the larger-than-human natural world an opportunity to fully flourish, as individuals shift from an ego-centered view and lifestyle, to an eco-centered view and lifestyle.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 383)

#### Eco-EPP addresses our existential anxieties while protecting the non-human world

Further, it proposes that addressing these anxieties through nature will also have a positive effect on the nonhuman world both because these anxieties often are what lead us to destructive and harmful actions against the world (and each other); and it has been repeatedly shown that the increasing our nature connection has the indirect effect of increasing pro-environmental behaviour. The reduced harm enacted against the natural world that arises from these two effects would theoretically reduce the trajectory and intensity of the various ecological and over climate crises that is intensifying our existential anxieties in a vicious feedback loop. 

#### Identity

The anxiety of identity is related to authenticity, it is having a sense of who we are and being able to feel into, be, and express who we are. However, it is more than that as it includes the sense of who we are as humans, which is intimately tied with our place in the universe.

Eco-EPP proposes that the incorporation of the natural/non-human world into one's sense of identity/self-construal positions oneself within a larger web of life, wherein our relationship to the other beings within that web helps us to better understand ourselves through giving us a sense of our essence as humans and our place within "the larger scheme of things" which offers us a greater sense of authenticity.

There is various research and anecdotal example and reasons that suggest that an identity forged from both human social and non-human natural dynamics is not only associated with, but might be a necessary component to human flourishing. 

To me, this is because we humans are, absolutely and truthfully, expressions of Nature and a part of the natural world and, whether it is conscious or not, we cannot feel whole without feeling at least connected to, if not as the nature world. If we never feel whole, we will never know ourselves, and thus can never feel, be, or express our authentic selves.

Thus, this greater sense of authenticity and sense of essence and place results from how our relationship with nature shapes our self-identity/self-construal. Our identity is always forged of our relationships, from early life onward, and our sense of self is placed within a "larger scheme" when the non-human world is an integral part of those relationships. 


> Eco-Existential Positive Psychology specifically incorporates the natural nonhuman environment into the search for self-identity. An expanded sense of self-identity that incorporates the natural world could help to reconcile people with the essence of who they are as human beings and with their unique place in the larger scheme of things, thus, resulting in a sense of authenticity.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 372)
....  
> Recognizing this innate and diverse tendency for identification with the natural world, Leary, Tipsord, and Tate (2008) proposed that an important category of self-construal is that of selfidentification with both the social (i.e., human) and natural (i.e., nonhuman) worlds.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 373)

#### Happiness 

The anxiety of happiness is about the deep need to experience happiness and the many crises that come into our lives when happiness is absent or inaccessible. It is also about what it is to be happy and how we can cultivate a life that includes happiness.


##### The 3 types of mature happiness 

EPPâ€”and by extension Eco-EPPâ€” presents 3 types of what they call mature happiness. Those are authentic, eudaimonic, and chaironic.

- Authentic happiness is that which arises from being an authentic person, of living our lives as expressions of ourselves honestly and unhindered in being and who we feel ourselves to be.
- Eudaimonic happiness is that which arises from living life as a "virtuous" person.
- Chaironic happiness is that which arises from our spirituality and the sense of being connected with our "spiritual nature"


> Wongâ€™s (2009) Existential Positive Psychology stresses the importance of an authentic self-identity. Three types of mature happiness are endorsed: (a) authentic happiness, that arises from being an authentic person, (b) eudaimonic happiness, which â€˜â€˜comes from doing virtuous deedsâ€™â€™ (p. 364), and (c) chaironic happiness, connected with our spiritual natureâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 371)

##### How nature supports us in our happiness

They proposed that the nature connectedness can offer us greater access to all three forms of mature happiness, as well as a sense of wellbeing in general by helping to satisfy what they called the "basic psychological needs" of "competence, relatedness, autonomy".


> Experiences in nature can result in a direct increase of various forms of happiness or well-being (e.g., eudaimonic and hedonic well-being, chaironic or spiritual well-being), in addition to increasing well-being via satisfaction of basic psychological needs (e.g., competence, relatedness, autonomy).â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 374)


For example, they presents how the [[@capaldiRelationshipNatureConnectedness2014|increases in hedonic happiness]]â€”feeling good in and about your lifeâ€”that come from increased nature connectedness can provide us a sense of vitality that supports us in our capacity to work towards **eudaimonic happiness.**


> In general, correlational studies have shown an inconsistent correlation between nature connectedness and hedonic well-being as measured by emotional well-being, life satisfaction, and positive affectâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 374)
....
> It is possible that nature connectedness relates to some aspects of hedonic functioning, such as vitality, more than others. Germane to this suggestion is Huta and Ryanâ€™s finding that vitality appears to be related equally to both eudaimonic and hedonic pursuits. In this vein, vitality has been demonstrated to increase after connecting with nature:â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 374)


As for **chaironic well-being, or spiritual well being**, the present both the anecdotal and literary history, as well as empirical research that shows the close association between nature connectedness and sense of spirituality. Interestingly, even among atheists, there is a tendency measure respect for nature as spiritual at the same level as Catholics and Buddhists would; as well as a tendency to "endorse" spirituality as an appropriate term for one's relationship to the appreciation of nature.


> Several studies provide empirical support for a close relationship between spirituality and nature connectednessâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 375)
....  
> The intertwining of spirituality and nature appears to be true even for those individuals who stringently reject a spiritual belief system involving a deity.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 375)
....  
> atheists agreed with statements that measured aspects of spirituality construed as respect for nature to the same extent as did Catholics and Buddhists. Furthermore, approximately one-third of the atheists endorsed the term spirituality in relation to an appreciation of nature, and nature was the most frequently cited source of wondermentâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 375)


With respect to **meeting basic psychological needs**, and thus offering us the kind of happiness in life that comes from those needs being met, the present nature as providing a context to satisfy our needs of competence, relatedness, and autonomy, which can then extend into other aspects of our lives.


> Well-being through meeting basic psychological needs.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 375)
....  
> involvement with nature may satisfy needs similar to those of competence, relatedness, and autonomyâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 375)
....  
> Interacting with nature also contributes indirectly to fulfilling our competency needs, in that the feelings of vitality nature inspires in us (see Nisbet et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2010) spill over into other areas of our livesâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 375)


>[! Tip] Authentic happiness
> They don't seem to address authentic happiness directly, but I assume that because feeling authentically ourselves through the resolution of identity anxiety contributes to the presence of authentic happiness. 

....  

#### Meaning in Life

They offered a number of different perspectives on nature and meaning in life. They went through several different proposals for what elements of life denote and offer a sense of meaning and then connected them to studies that seem to link nature immersion and/or connection to offering that element of meaning.

One example was that an identification/strong relationship with nature provides a kind of meaningful stability in life, as Nature offers a kind of permenance in its presenceâ€”Nature itself, not any particular expression of it, e.g. a specific forest or riverbankâ€”in contrast to the constant changes in fascination and priority in modern society and culture.


> Meaning in life stems, in part, from an individualâ€™s identification with elements of stable patterns and permanency within a changing world (Baumeister, 1991), beliefs that life fits within a larger scheme (Wong, 2010), and an individualâ€™s ability for self-transcendence (Emmons, 2005; Frankl, 1959=1984; Steger, 2009; Wong, 1998). Theoretically, it has been suggested that these key elements of meaning in life can be found in nature.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 376)


Another was that being in Nature provides us a kind of spaciousness that helps us with a perspective on life otherwise not available, which in turn helps use gather new meaning or derive meaning from events or experiences in life that we would not have been able to otherwise. ("perspective-making power of nature")  

There were many more examples, and one that really stuck with me was the proposal that meaning in life can come from connection itself, and from connection with something that has "independent worth". This section of the paper reminded me of [[@vervaekeRelevanceMeaningCognitive2013#The three dimensions of living a good life|Vervaeke's proposal of a good life includes a sense of meaning, and that meaning comes from feeling connected with something that means more than the meaning we attribute to it.]]


> Baumeister and Vohs (2002) put forth that â€˜â€˜the essence of meaning is connectionâ€™â€™ (p. 608); various forms of connectionâ€”including a connection to natureâ€”have been surmised to provide coherence and meaning in life. Heine, Proulx, and Vohs (2006) emphasized that meaning is found in connecting the self to the external world; consistent with this idea, Haybron (2011) suggested that nature experiences may yield meaning by their provision of â€˜â€˜engagement with matters of independent worthâ€™â€™ (p. 238). Note (2009) also made reference to the meaningfulness that can be derived from our sense of experiencing nature as an external reality with which we form an ethical, reciprocal relationship that involves transcending our immediate spatial reference. â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 376)
  
....  

#### Isolation

The anxiety of isolation relates to the feeling of being separate, and in that separation distant and alone in existence. 

Some say that this prevailing sense of isolation is, itself, a symptom of our disconnection from Nature. (Or, insofar as the work of Darcia Narvaez, a symptom of our species no longer providing The Evolved Nest to its young and resulting in us living with [[Connection vs Disconnection as Primary|Disconnection as primary]].) And thus, in a deep sense of connection with Nature, that isolation is reduced or resolved.


> Nelson (1993) suggested that isolation from the natural community has created for us a â€˜â€˜profound and imperiling lonelinessâ€™â€™ (p. 221). Experiences with nature afford us a greater sense of relatedness and social connectedness.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 377)


Nonetheless, we can see a deeper sense of connection is people (and thus less sense of isolation) when they are connected to animals, such as pets. This is not only to their pets, but to other people through their pets as animals create contexts and opporunties for interactions with other humans.

Further, research has shown that expsoure to natural lanscapes has the effect of [[@weinsteinCanNatureMake2009|increasing intrinsic aspriations and decreasing extrinstic aspirations]]. Essentially, it triggers us to value caring for relaitonships and community more then wealth and fame. The result of which is less isolation through a greater sense of connectedness through more relationship.


  
....  

#### Freedom


The anxiety of freedom is stems from a desire to be able to be ourselves and express ourselves and feel our feelings, as well as to generally not feel trapped in our lives. Freedom, however, must be balanced with responsibility.  

Nature offers us these things in the balance we need. It has no arbitrary expectation of us, allowing us the freedom to simply exist in the moment, to be. 


> Nature does not impose on us expectations of arbitrary social propriety; we are free simply to be.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 379)


However, it invites us into the balance of freedom and responsibility because we need to care for ourselves and attend to our needs in order to survive. If we get cold, we must cover ourselves or make fire; thirsty, we must find water; etc. Further, "behaviour and its consequences" become very apparent to us when in Nature, and this offers us lessons in the balance between freedom and responsibility


> We propose that natural environments appear to provide a foundational setting for this balance to occur. This is due, in part, to the fact that the link between behavior and its consequences are apparent in an immediate and fundamental way in a natural setting (Scherl, 1989). For example, if we are cold when outside, it is up to us to take steps to warm ourselves via starting a fire or donning extra layers of clothes. Dramatic illustrations of this can be found in nature adventure literature. A common theme in this literature is that these seekers of freedom, personal expression, and adventure do not entertain illusions of nature as a beneficent mother; rather these responders to the call of the wild understand that their journey will also entail peril, adversity, and great challengesâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 380)



#### Death


The anxiety of death and how we grapple with it is a primary influence on the shape of our lives.

Nature connectedness helps us orient ourselves within a larger frame than our personal lives, and places our lives and our deaths in a larger and rhythm order of life, connecting us to something beyond our personal lifetime. Something that came before us and continues on after our personal death, and continues because of death, because of the give and take of birth and death in all things.

> Connecting with nature embeds us more deeply into the existence of life beyond the course of our single lifetime (Berger, 1980).â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 381)
...
> Although the natural rhythms of the Earth as it passes from day to night, and season to season, provide a daily reminder of our own mortality and the transitory nature of our own beingsâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 381)
....  
> We accept that, not only is death inevitable, but that death is, in fact, â€˜â€˜necessary to maintain the greater life of the Earth itself,â€™â€™ and by extension, ourselves (Pienaar, 2011, p. 27; see also Lifton, 1979).â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 381)


Further, this is all part of a proposal they make that Nature provides us a symbolism we need to contextualize our living and our dying in a way that help us grapple with the anxeity of death in a way that gives life greater meaning, or at the very least doesn't suction meaning from our lives.


> From a Jungian perspective on ecopsychology, Pienaar (2011) argued that nature, serving as a symbolic representation of time, serves to increase our existential awareness of our own mortality, that we experience nature as a continuity of the self, and that the human psyche is coextensive with nature.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 381)
....  
> The struggle for existence, the flourishing of life even in harsh conditions, and the cycle of lifeâ€”deathâ€”life-born-anew are salient features of the natural environment that provide us withâ€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 381)
....
> symbols of transcendent immortality that we can identify with and find solace in.â€”(Passmore and Howell, 2014, p. 382)
