### Introduction

"When we grasp fully that the best expressions of our humanity were not invented by civilization but by cultures that preceded it, that the natural world is not only a set of constraints but of contexts within which we can more fully realize our dreams, we will be on the way to a long overdue reconciliation between opposites which are of our own making". 

— Paul Shepard, Coming Home to the Pleistocene, ed. Florence R. Shepard (Washington, DC: Island Press, 1998).

##### WHAT IS A WORLDVIEW:

"that worldview is not interchangeable with concepts such as ideology, paradigm, religion, or discourse, although such concepts do emerge from a worldview, the source of our beliefs and behaviors. Worldview goes deeper than culture, religion, or philosophy, all of which are fueled by the underlying assumptions we have" 
([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=29))

*This is something I am uncertain about… is it suggesting that a worldview is something like the foundational model that informs how we perceive reality—our, self the world and our place within the world—rather than the content reference points that orient how we understand and navigate those perceptions?  

^^^Update after interview clarifies...

*There are only 2 worldviews available at this time…. Indigenous interconnection with all life; dominant separation/duality from life. ([note on p.29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=29))*


**The self as infromed by the indigenous way of raising children**

*The indigenous way builds the self as an expression of relationship with the living land, that relationship being informed by meaningful experiences of the spiritual energies alive within the land. With raising children, there was a concerted effort to encourage them to be alone in the land and develop that relationship in the foundational times in their lives. But we can develop this at any age, by accident (spontaneous event in nature) or intentionally (such as the eco attachment dance).  

Reading this I find myself saddened and isolated from nature… my home space is lacking due to construction and other things. My potential future home space has no access to a garden or wildness of any type. This brings me a deep sadness. ([note on p.37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=37))*


**definition**

"identitarian" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=37))

*A kind of supremacy that hold certain identities above others. ([note on p.37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=37))*
my note^

....

***Hierarchies of power in indigenous societies** develop naturally as a consequence of certain members of the group earning greater respect amongst the group for differing reasons. .. rather than through conquest and control a la western society.  
Also, power itself is not about power over, but power within, person internal power, spiritual Etc, which earns the respect of one’s fellows. ([note on p.39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=39))*





QUOTE -- 
**here are no winners under a colonial regime**

"If time has taught us anything it is that there are no winners under a colonial regime. To oppress human diversity and assert authority without consent is to deny human capability both in terms of individualization and collectivities. Colonial ideologies such as eurocentrism, racism, oppression and hegemonic control are used to promote and sustain a colonial regime that denies equally the colonized and the colonizers of their full human potential.

##### Indigenous collectivism's impact on individuality and competitiveness vs dominant worldview

*The collectivist cultures of indigenous peoples do not leave individuals within it less unique, self-sufficient, or independent compared the the cultures of the western world. Apparently the result on one’s general autonomy and individually is the same with both, but that indigenous culture tend to leave those individuals with lower competitiveness. ([note on p.42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=42))*


"!e problem with hierarchy is, as Wenona says, about how" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=42))

"colonized hierarchical perspectives assert authority without consent." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=43))


##### Human's naturally gravitate towards egalitarianism if...

*Humans tend to gravitate towards egalitarianism when we are given experiences of playful egalitarianism as children. But when we are stressed and and wounded by the imposition of static hierarchies forced upon us in childhood, that wounded mess as adult leaves us tending towards perfecting static hierarchy and control in our lives (in the position of dominant or submissive),

**Quote**
"our human instincts still are to be egalitarian when we are wellnurtured and have experiences of playful egalitarianism— but modern society raises children to be easily stressed and stresses them as adults so much that many can't think or feel properly and so learn to prefer authoritarianism." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=43))




....

##### Authoritarianism as an instinct response to being traumatized


Our inclination to authoritarianism is not a human invention, but a natural response to being traumatized. We can see the same response amongst other animals. But that egalitarianism is where we would be if we weren’t perpetually wounded and shaped by a culture that fetishizes the domination that is a distorted expression of its own woundedness, all while further wounding each other and the land  

That wounded land, the natural world we are damaging in this process, further alienating ourselves from it, is the place where we as humans learned to live in symbiosis with each other. The land was our living example, and our disconnection from that example is growing as the consequence is it further destruction to appease the desperate failings of our fetishized wounded self-aggrandizement ([note on p.46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=46))*


> "instinctive submission to authority comes from an early life experience of trauma or neglect that creates a brain that is threat reactive and easily submits to a powerful authority "gure. !e Nazis knew to mistreat young children to create submissive conformists. !e brain learns, from early life stress, to shut down when distress becomes too great, going into a type of survival mode related to shutting down thinking and feeling—an immobility— in order to stay alive. A&er rehearsing this routinely without mitigation, the child automatically enters this dissociation habit when afraid." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=43))

##### Honour Children to support the world beyond us

"The important thing is to know how to honor children, paying attention to how you are treating them, because you are affecting not only their lifelong wellbeing but that of future generations." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=48)) -- Darcia

**Sprits arriving in one's dying time**

"In my work, I cannot remember a person who did not have spirits come to their consciousness in their last days, once we evoke them. At first, some deny them or fear them, but those who have not been taught such things, embrace them. Traditional Indigenous people with their worldview still strong often smile at them. They know the cyclical way life and death operate and see little difference between living a good life and dying a good death." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:64](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=64))

*I find myself inclining towards the supporting of dying folks as a potential future direction for my life. And yet it would come with great sacrifice and consequence to what my life experience will be… the nuances of that being mostly ambiguous and I remain ambivalent to the idea....  As well as calls to be more in communion with the spirit world. ([note on p.67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=67))*


**Right Brain Function and the Fear of Death**

"The inability to tune into transcendent reality, reliant on right brain hemisphere functioning that is undermined in civilization's child raising, will make death seem like "the end" rather than a transition to a new beginning." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:68](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=68))

*Further indication of the importance of rebuilding right sided function. ([note on p.68](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=68))*


**The Four Principles of the Zapotecan Culture**

"Zapotecan culture in the Sierra Juárez is based on four life principles: Fursst, everything has life; second, reverence for Mother Nature; third, reverence for our ancestors; fourth, the relationship between human beings and Mother Nature. !ese four principles have been the foundation of our laws in our communities for thousands and thousands of years." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:69](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=69))




**True Listening and Eldering**

"true listening—listening that keeps us (1) remembering the ultimate, longerterm importance of our decisions and actions; (2) never forgetting our interconnectedness with all; (3) appreciating the nature of feelings and how they often relate to forgetting to accept the unknown; (4) holding on to authentic humility; and (5) remembering who we really are, with great appreciation for those who came before us who did similar work or who have made our work somewhat easier or clearer." -- Jacobs ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=74))



"As James Clark Moloney wrote: "A baby frustrated too often during his state of preverbal helplessness is well on the way toward developing enduring and crippling feelings of ugliness, inferiority, and futility."9 It is hard to care for the community of life if you do not feel cared for." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=75))

"the vibrational Frequency one feels when one is genuinely part of a healthy, happy community that is connected to the land and its creatures." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=76))

###### Perception of reality is influenced by the energetic frequency of our environmental Context

noted here:  [[Perception of reality is influenced by the energetic frequency of our environmental Context]]


> "There is something in our electromagnetic field that is disruptive to harmony. I feel it sitting here in front of the computer for hours writing, in contrast to stepping outside and smelling the ocean breeze or standing next to the cactus. There does seem to be a vibration, a rhythm that influences how social relationships change in relationship to natureculture dynamics." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=76))

....

##### Matriarchy etymology

*Matriarchy etymology linking more to the beginning of life than the rule of women, being that mater is mother and to mother is to bring into this world. ([note on p.82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=82))*

"Goettner-Abendroth points out that while the term "patriarchy" is associated with domination by males, the etymology of arche in "matriarchy," because of women's ability to grow life, better refers to "from the beginning" or the "original pattern from which models are made," the meaning related to arche in "archetype." She writes: "Lacking a clear scientific definition of 'matriarchy,' the term has been misunderstood as 'rule by women,' provoking a lasting, ideologically distorted prejudice against it. !e "eld of modern matriarchal studies reorients the field with more precise de"nitions."6 Matriarchal societies are centralized around the feminine principle that sources the beginning of every human's life. 

So matriarchy does not refer to "ruling over" but to egalitarianism and freedom for both genders through complementary functions. Goettner-Abendroth identified the characteristics of matriarchies around the world: economic mutuality and a gift economy; matrilineal, nondomination kinship; egalitarian consensus; and sacred cultures of the feminine divine. All these characteristics seem to match up with the Indigenous worldview we are discussing" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=82)) -- Darcia

**Polysemic vs univocity thinking**

*Polysemic vs univocity thinking… 

*Polysemic is where experience of self is not differentiated from other and the cognitive/rational mind was not dominant form of perception but a part of a more horizonatlly diversified multisensory basis for percepting, understanding, and navigating reality. Being in a flow state is being in a polysemic state

 Univocity thinking—rational/linear/cause and effect —is about differentiation, categorization, dissection, and creating hiearchy.

The long history of Western thought is also a history of unvocity Dominating and supressing polsemic thinking, starting with the Sumerian civiliation.*  

**noted:** [[Polysemic vs univocity thinking]]

...

"Prior to the Sumer civilization and subsequent civilizations, human societies shifted between polysemy, a multisensory participation in a living, permeable world, and univocity, linear logical thought used to solve a specific problem with conscious cause and effect analysis. 

Polysemic mentalization does not make differentiations between self and others, including particular animals, plants, or natural entities (e.g., rivers), whereas univocity is all about differentiation, categorizing, and creating hierarchies. 

Western history, as Bram tells it, is a story about the suppression of polysemy and dominance of univocity, which parallels the suppression of the feminine principle of cycling through birth, life," ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=82))

**The Lakota Understanding Of Marriage**

"the description of marriage. It's called *tawicuton*. Tawicuton—ta means "his"; wi is the sun; cu, you take part of the sun to create life. That is our definition of married people, two people living together. And that's so important. It's so different from the word "married." You say "my wife" like you own a woman. That's just contrary to Lakota belief." - Jacobs  ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=87))

....


**How external rules that do no accord to reality disturb our sense of connection**

"Colonizers use explicate order concepts that do not fit dynamic reality. Thus, the way most of us are raised and socialized encourages us to get caught in an enclosed feedback loop of cultural distortion. The idea of a static world full of separated objects has caused endless problems as experts isolate fragments of reality and take actions that do not account for their impact on the whole. And then they try to fix the symptom instead of the cause of the problem, creating more problems. If we don't step back from our own ego involvement in an opinion or action, we can actually perpetuate misinformation and error, factors that underlie all the human problems we face. Sociocultural beliefs are part of the distortion." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=94))

...

"Your invitation to the reader to not spend so much time thinking about things is also an invitation to focus more on relationships. **Giving significance to relationships is the essence of Indigenous spirituality."** ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=103))

.....

"Indigenous worldview emphasizes, as Rebecca Adamson says, "the relevance for relationship and the sacredness of creation." It is not about ascetic notions that do not enjoy the physicality of life and its pleasures, but rather about a knowing balance that has Nature-based priorities in place. All that is necessary to realize the dangerous impact of our materialistic world is to look around." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=107))




...

**It's not just business**

*The me thing for me here about the disconnection and then affiliation with the disconnected system as an excuse for these sociopathic behaviours ([note on p.105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=105))* 

For example, [[It's not just business]]


"The learner is not separated from community to learn abstractions but learns within the community the personal knowledge needed for practical wisdom, the coordination and integration of all these areas. !is is radically different from a dominating worldview that seems to use compartmentalizing and theorizing to justify acting like an ecological and relational sociopath." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=105))


"To keep us enchanted with the status quo, the dominant economic system and modern economics have to "externalize" (not take into count) effects on the natural world or on the health of individuals and communities." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=104))

**"The guidelines for the Honorable Harvest"**

- Know the ways of the ones who take care of you, so that you may take care of them. 
- Introduce yourself. Be accountable as the one who comes asking for life. 
- Ask permission before taking. Abide by the answer
- Never take the (rst. Never take the last.
- Take only what you need. 
- Take only that which is given. 
- Never take more than half. Leave some for others. 
- Harvest in a way that minimizes harm. 
- Use it respectfully. Never waste what you have taken. 
- Share. 
- Give thanks for what you have been given. 
- Give a gift, in reciprocity for what you have taken. 
- Sustain the ones who sustain you and the earth will last forever.

 ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=109))



"The state guidelines on hunting and gathering are based exclusively in the biophysical realm, while the rules of the Honorable Harvest are based on accountability to both the physical and the metaphysical worlds. The taking of another life to support your own is far more significant when you recognize the beings who are harvested as persons, nonhuman persons vested with awareness, intelligence, spirit—and who have families waiting for them at home. Killing a who demands something different than killing an it. When you regard those nonhuman persons as kinfolk, another set of harvesting regulations extends beyond bag limits and legal seasons." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=110))



"Sharon said, "It is the way we do it that counts." This is what virtue is all about, the manner of behavior. It's not enough to go through the motions, to do something that your heart is not into. This is contrary to the dominant view in Western scholarship that you must go against your inclinations for something to count as moral. It's so upside down." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=121))

**A Indigenous Based Critique of Kant's understanding of the development of the self**

> "I think human beings are messed up in childhood in all sorts of ways through coercive force, a Western tradition with its most famous articulation given by philosopher Immanuel Kant. Philosopher John Watson (1847-1939) explained the perspective: 
> 
> 	At first everyone is under apparent bondage to his superiors in the family relation, but in reality this is the means by which a measure of freedom is attained. It is true that he must render implicit obedience to those in authority over him, but in so doing he learns to free himself from an undue accentuation of his own individual desires and to seek his freedom where alone it can be found—in the subordination of his own will to the good of others." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=121))
> 
> "So here we have the early divorce of self, intuition, and action. !e child learns not to trust the self. It's hard to become virtuous if you were divorced from your spirit. We also have the training grounds for dominancesubmission relationships—some people have power and others must subordinate themselves. We'll contrast the differences in child raising more speci"cally later." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=122)) - Darcia


**The Characteristics of Play**

"the spirit of play. Peter Gray lists the characteristics of play identified by play scholars: 

(1) self-directed and self-chosen; 
(2) intrinsically motivated for play; 
(3) guided by flexible, creative mental rules; 
(4) imaginative—separated from real world serious activity; 
(5) conducted in a non-stressed but active and alert frame of mind. 

The more of these characteristics an activity has, the more playlike it is."

**Who Did Jesus Die for?**

*It is common in the rehortic of christinaty to conceive the sacrice Jesus made being for the redemption of mankind, and mankind alone. Perhaps and more likely, though, is that his sacrifice was for the redemption of all life, for all creation. Not just us.*

"Seldom in evangelical writing does the idea that Jesus came to give his life so that the rest of creation might also be redeemed find its expression. When I teach about this, I tell my students that if at the conclusion of my course they do not believe that Jesus died for your dog, they need to think again about the nature of their creation theology" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:128](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=128))

**A definition of Indigenous Nonanthropocentrism according to Four Arrows**


After referring the failures of a number of others word to describe indigenous nonanthropocentrism—eg as biocentrism, panpsychism, animisa, etc—Four Arrows presents that in order to explain it, the "best" her can do is "briefly explain the nonanthropocentric Indigenous worldview precept is to simply list my own descriptors: 

1. The precept is place-based, with place uniquely mirroring its own version of the cosmos. So each nonanthropocentric understanding is similar in terms of the common Indigenous worldview, but different in terms of details relating to unique location on the earth. 
2. In essence, humans belong to the land, not vice versa
3. There is a mysterious, loving, creative force who, with helpers from the nonhuman world, created an interconnected world. 
4. This original sacred energy pervades everything, making us humans—along with all other forms of life—family or kin. !is comes with responsibility for caring for all members of this family. 
5. Every element of creation has a spiritual presence that we all share but also has its own agency and unique wisdom designed to foster owing balance in the universe. 
6. All elements, including rocks, water, mountains, and thunder, are animated with individual personalities.
7. Humans cannot fully explain any of this, but they use reflection upon lived experience and wisdom stories handed down generationally to guide other humans to find their own way.

##### How childrearing in the Dominant worldview impairs our sense of reality

"I think deception in civilized countries starts with poor baby care, where the baby is told "I love you" by a parent and then left alone, left to cry, or forced into an adult schedule. That doesn't feel like love. It's a lie. The baby will feel subconsciously disconnected from self, others, and the world and will have to and an outlet for deep anxiety, and sometimes a target for rage. Then as the child grows older, the child is punished for following urges to learn and grow, so the child starts to lie to avoid punishment. I think this sets people up for believing and living in a world of deception and falsehoods. They get thrown off their natural development and have an impaired sense of reality. They become easily manipulated by halftruths by master manipulators." -- Darcia ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:140](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=140))



**"Jiddu Krishnamurti says about fear:** 

It is really very important while you are young to live in an environment in which there is no fear... Most of us have fear in one form or another; and where there is fear, there is no intelligence. And is it not possible for all of us, while we are young, to be in an environment where there is no fear but rather an atmosphere of freedom—freedom, not just to do what we like, but to understand the whole process of living? Life is really very beautiful; it is not this ugly thing that we have made of it... To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom... We must create immediately an atmosphere of freedom so that you can live and "nd out for yourselves what is true, so that you become intelligent, so that you are able to face the world and understand it, not just conform to it... It is only when you are constantly inquiring, constantly observing, constantly learning, that you find truth, God, or love; and you cannot inquire, observe, learn, you cannot be deeply aware, if you are afraid. So the function of education, surely, is to eradicate, inwardly as well as outwardly, this fear that destroys human thought, human relationship and love."

Jiddu Krishnamurti, “This Matter of Culture-1964,” in Michael Mendizza, ed., Unconditionally Free: The Life and Insights of J. Krishnamurti (Ojai, CA: Krishnamurti Foundation of America, 2020), 165–66.

**Threat hinders our access to the connected flow of existence**

*To enter our natural state of creative liminal connected flow of existence, we need to downthrottle from threat response and/or exit the problem solving mode of thinking ([note on p.152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=152))*

"Unless we are in a logical thinking/problem solving mode or in considerable distress, we reside in such a connected flow of existence, a receptive, creative liminal space." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=152))

...


**Solar lunar vs masculine feminine**

*Perhaps, given the sticky nature of terms like masculine-feminine as description of natural energies/archetypal principles, it might make more sense to use the language of Solar-Lunar instead.

This would address the issues of implying the social constructs inherent in any gendering, while also addressing the imposition of anthropocentric biases onto the non-human world. 

Wherein the use of masculine/feminine inherently comes through the lens of being human as the primary nature of being and the use solar/lunar flips this and places the primary as the beyond-human reality of the rest of life.* 

...

"Regarding the male female problematic, my work with Dr. Howard Teich6 over many years has brought me to see that a better way to discuss it uses "solar lunar" language. Teich has studied twinhero stories from around the world. He finds that coincidental with humanity's separation from Nature and its establishment of more hierarchal, patriarchal nation states, the original Indigenous archetype for twins is modified in the Western myths. Like Jung, he saw constrictions implicit in assigning gender labels to solar and lunar principles. Over the years I have found that replacing "masculine and feminine" with "solar and lunar" when helping clients with related problems has significant benefits." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=161))

"Typically, the Lunar Twin is slain in favor of the Solar Twin. The dominant culture, up to now, has hailed only the Solar Twin as its prototype of masculinity, consigning the Lunar Twin to impotence and oblivi" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:162](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=162))

*Twin hero myths, further follow up from the previous discussion about solar lunar over masc/fem ([note on p.162](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=162))*


**Wetiko**


"Today, wétiko-solarity is infused into most world systems at sociopolitical levels, so people are born into a world of wétiko-solarity. They are undercared for and so are susceptible individually to wétiko. !ere are now so many ways to get stuck in wétiko-solarity: disconnection, fear, self-protectionism, cultural stories, lack of attention, inability to perceive, inexperience, ego in action, and/or poor role modeling that is imitated mindlessly. Children are also taught to believe wetiko-solarity is a normal human orientation or even "human progress." !e world is currently stuck in an inflamed wétiko-solarity cancer." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:163](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=163))



**Complimentarism / Complementary Dualism**


"Hillary Webb's research with Andean Quechua people focuses on yanantin, a concept that is about the Quechua's emphasis on seeking complementary dualism.18 She concludes that complementarity does not require harmony, but it does require recognition. She says the Quechua shamans, who were her research participants, explained to her that those who seem very di%erent from us can serve to help us see ourselves more clearly. She says a complementary worldview that tries to bring antagonisms into interrelationship forces us to go deeper into ourselves to learn what must be learned to live in $owing balance." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=165))

*Yantanin is an a dream Quechua term/concept for complimentary dualism, wherein things I dualistic contrast to each other are seen as revealing them to themselves through each other.  
As in, that which I am dualistic to reveals me to myself. Through this complimentarism can be discovered and even if not then the mindset itself provides a basis for encouraging a learning mindset applied to the challenges of facing that which we are dualistic too, rather than failing into antagonism in one form or another.

**GENEROSITY as the highest expression of courage**


"Of course, real giving entails sacrifce—if it doesn't cost you something, it is not generosity. Thus, if I were to give away that necktie that Aunt Mildred gave me last Christmas—the one that I was never going to wear in public—it would not be generosity, it would be recycling!"

**CEREMONY as life sustaining**

*Linda Hogan (Chickasaw)  
Ceremony’s purpose is to help us remember Connection.... All my relations is an expression of that, and is a way in which it is called in. ([note on p.177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=177))*

"We remember that all things are connected. Remembering this is thet is the mending of a broken connection between us and the rest" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=177))

"the participants in a ceremony say the words "All my relations" before and a"er we pray; those words create a relationship with other people, with animals, with the land. To have health it is necessary to keep all these relations in mind" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=177))

"It is an event that sets us back upright. But it is not a Finished thing. The real ceremony begins where the formal one ends, when we take up a new way, our minds and hearts (lled with the vision of earth that holds us within it, in compassionate relationship to and with our world." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=177))



"Ceremonies transcend the boundaries of the individual and resonate beyond the human realm. They magnify life. Starting every gathering with a ceremony acknowledging relationship and expressing gratitude toward the other than human sets the mind in the right space—for humility instead of arrogance, communal imagination instead of self-oriented imagination, emotional presence instead of mindlessness. Ceremony focuses attention where it becomes intention. When you stand together and profess a thing before your community, it holds you accountable. These acts of reverence are powerfully pragmatic." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:251](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=251))

**There Is No Real Aloneness**

"There is no real aloneness. There is solitude and the nurturing silence that is relationship with ourselves, but even then we are part of something larger." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=178))

"Linda Hogan. Dwellings: A Spiritual History of the Living World, 40-41. New York: W. W. Norton, 1995." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=178))

"But for the dominant worldview, which aligns with Western history, ceremony typically involves human community and a particular notion of the divine as outside the self. If the rest of Earth's persons are included—the other than human—it occurs superficially. There is no sense of nations of bear, wolf, oak, pine, or water spirits. Nature is more like wallpaper than a complex set of communities with which humans interact" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=180))

**Guide To Ceremony - Daniel Wolpert**

"Daniel Wolpert offers a helpful guide that can be used to create our own ceremonies. He selects five elements as a framework for learning an embodied appreciation of the earth through ceremony for each element, propelling self-transformation away from ego and toward wisdom. 

In daily experience, we can express appreciation for each of these: 

space, for spacious hospitality instead of ignorance; 
water, for vision instead judgmental arrogance; 
air, for compassionate action instead of aggression and anxiety; 
earth, for abundance and generosity instead of a sense of poverty and grasping action; 
fire, for warm relationships instead of loneliness and insecurity. 

Wolpert gives guidance on how to experience each of these elements through reverent attention and apply them to one's relationships and behavior. These concrete ways to revamp ourselves align with what Hogan says: 

"The intention of a ceremony is to put a person back together by restructuring the human mind."" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=183))



**Reductionism, conservatism and Dualities Suppress Play**


"The Blatners point out that the Western world's intellectual history of simplifying reality also suppresses play. This includes dualistic belief systems, both religious (something is good or is evil) and scientific (something is true or is false). Other dualistic pairs that straitjacket people's orientation and behavior include adult/childish, male/female, serious/foolish, civilized/primitive, strength/weakness. 

According to Steve Allen, humor rarely comes from the conservative side of the political spectrum because conservatives traditionally prefer to support rather than make fun of society's institutions. 

Neurobiologically, conservatism often represents inflexibility of one kind or another, focused on keeping the structure of things as they are rather than attending to living beings themselves. Imaginative play is about interacting with one another as living beings, disregarding the boundaries of conformity culture, challenging black-and-white categorizations. It prepares people to understand reality as a gray, overlapping, interpenetrating mixture of fuzzy, shifting categories." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=191))

*The locked in reductionism of dualities and dualistic thinking limits ones capacity to be playful with categories and tease what is in healthy and heart-full ways. Without that kind to play in childhood, with too much conservatism, our brain don't develop the capacity to hold reality and life for the complexity is truly is. This later impacts our adulthood as we further lack these capacities for play, which according to Huberman does us a great disservice with respect to our long term neurobiological and cognitive health.

**Indigenous understanding for restoring justice, rooted in community cause and thus community resolution**

"Looking beyond those immediately involved, Indigenous people tend to interpret hurtful actions less individualistically and more as signs of imbalances within the community as a whole—imbalances that affect everyone. In this sense, o'enders help the community by drawing attention to imbalances. Their actions tell us that the essential fabric of the community is starting to unravel and needs mending... Instead of placing all the blame on the o'ender, our traditions acknowledge that everyone in the community has played some role in the patterns that culminated in hurtful actions. The responsibility for harms is distributed and shared." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=194))

**Some routine practices that will support our ability to conflict resolve**

"the four horsemen of the environmental apocalypse are upon us, one of which is mass extinction; the others are massive toxi"cation of earth systems, degradation of the atmosphere, and global warming.8" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:200](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=200))

"These are routine Indigenous ways of being that we can pull out to practice: Practice self-calming. Find different techniques to calm your body (e.g., lying on the earth, lying in the sun, taking a hot bath, cuddling with others) and to calm your mind (meditation/prayer, chanting, visualization, reminding yourself of why you are here). 

Group ceremony, practiced in the Indigenous way, calms us together. Practice social joy. Find ways to connect with people, plants, and animals. One of the best ways to connect is to play, which we discussed in the humor chapter. Singing and dancing with others also helps. You can sit in silent enjoyment of a plant and even have a conversation with a stone. Expand your communal imagination. Remember that you are a part of the web of life, and what you do affects all your human and other-than-human relations. 

It is important to decolonize your mind of Western root metaphors that straitjacket imagination: human separation from and superiority to the rest of nature, progress as overturning traditional knowledge, and individualism. 

To this list of ideas to be cleansed, we could add the opposites of all the precepts we are discussing." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:201](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=201))

**Learning morality from plants through metaphor** 

*The journey of learning the landscape starts with finding plants, connecting with them leads to “your metaphors”, and those metaphors become your moral landscape. \*\*\*flush this out  
“Landscape grounded morality”


"We all have to find our unique ways of taking our cognitive journeys on our landscapes.  Dennis Martinez suggests a great way to do this: find the plants. Connect with them and your cognitive journey begins, and next your metaphors will begin, and that place becomes your moral landscape." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:205](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=205))



**The Importence of WATER**


"Ask people what they think the most important things in in their life are, and seldom will anyone refer to water." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:210](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=210))

"Abraham Maslow's interest in human potential intrigued him the most, and so he did some investigation of what it looks like. In comparison to other members of (US) society, he described selfactualizers as having the following traits:1 erception of reality e of self, others, and nature plicity, and naturalness entatio" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=213))

##### Language and it's impact on perception

"Western IndoEuropean languages, which emphasize nouns, can give us a static view of life, making the world seem full of objects we manipulate, whereas Native languages typically emphasize verbs, emphasizing the dynamic beingness of all. For Indigenous peoples, living life is perceived as an ongoing unfolding organic change, a "continuous birth. One is continually present as witness to the moment, always moving like the crest of a wave, at which the world is about to disclose itself for what it is." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=216))

**Becoming Fully Human**

"For Indigenous people this is about living according to the precepts put forth in this book. For example, the Lakota say in order to be a human being we must learn to authentically and consistently practice the following virtues: Wóčhekiya—Prayer Wičákha—Honesty Wahwala—Humility Waúnšila—Compassion Waóhola—Respect Wawokiye—Generosity Wóksape—Wisdom The capability of humans to lose their humanity seems to be a unique trait of our species."

**It benefits out neurobiology to sit/stand on the earth without synthetic barriers, such as the decrease of cortisol and increase in oxytocin**

"When our spirits sag and are burdened with cares, worries, losses and sorrows, Mother Earth comforts us. She whispers and chants to the downhearted and dispirited through the tree tops, over the meadows, in cascades and rapids. It is a mother's soothing voice o'ering solace to the low in spirit. She whispers, "I love you. I care."" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:222](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=222))

"Neurobiologically speaking, going barefoot or sitting on the earth with no synthetic barrier causes physiological changes in our bodies." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:223](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=223))

"Cortisol, the mobilizing and stress hormone, decreases, and oxytocin increases, making one feel more relaxed, more open." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:224](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=224))

...

**Practice Gratitude In Minute Ways**


"I remind myself to apply a gratitude principle in daily life, not only through gratitude over a meal or for gifts from family and work colleagues, but in minute ways for kin relations—the Indigenous way. 

For example, when I step on asphalt, I remember I walk on our fossil ancestors; on the sidewalk, I step on rock and sand kin. 

When I breathe, I benefit from the exhalations of plant kin. All around me are descendants of our common ancestors—trees, grasses, deer, flies—all are part of a web of a living earth that makes human life possible, a community of sisters, brothers, and elders. To give back, I sing to them, with gratitude and love, encouraging them to continue their being, their flourishing. 

My desire for finalizing my body's grateful return to the earth, rather than being buried isolated in a box of some sort, is to be buried in a mushroom suit, immediately feeding and rejoining the cosmos again." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:255](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=255))


.....

**How we respond to something—intellect vs heart wisdom—and its connection to our capacity for being in the flow of life**

"It turns out that at the beginning of each situation, we can choose which mode we will employ. 

Warning: once we have chosen the intellect mode, it is very difficult to shift to the heart mode. We have all probably noticed this, such as when brainstorming ideas in a group. If someone starts to edit or criticize, the creative juices stop flowing, and it is hard to get back to the free- flowing mode. 

The intellect mode comes to a social situation by categorizing the other person (e.g., fatter than me, weaker than me, more important than me), selecting a script or set of rules for the encounter (e.g., they should show subservience to my superior intellect), and critiquing anything that doesn't follow the script. In fact, this mode is unaware of the whole. The goal by and large is domination and control of what is perceived, governed by some abstracted ideal.

In contrast, the heart mode comes to a situation with an openness to the beauty and uniqueness of the other, ready to cocreate a new interpersonal dance in the moment, aware of shared living energy, dissolving separation, "connecting us with our ground of being."14 Sorenson describes this holistic approach in heartcentered (Indigenous) communities: "People freely spread their interests, feelings and" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:292](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=292))

"delights out for all to see and grasp as they lurched toward whatever delightful patterns of response they found attractive."15 It is not about control, planned outcomes, or rules, but about creative interaction." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:293](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=293))

"For example, a 2016 study concluded that wisdom-related judgment is neither an exclusive function of the mind nor of the body. "Rather, both greater heart rate variability and an ego-decentered mind are required for a wiser, less biased judgment."21 !e study suggests that increasing the psychological distance from our own self-centered perspective when assessin" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:294](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=294))

Where each of you are coming from in the book....

.....

You propose that "There are only 2 worldviews available at this time…. Indigenous interconnection with all life; dominant separation/duality from life."

Define what a worldview is, a general run down of these two worldviews, and why you feel there are only these two presently...

Some of the precepts, 

Is this an exhuastive list?




"I recently shared this at a presentation at the University of British Columbia, and someone asked why I am still doing this work if I believe there is little chance to turn things around.

([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:206](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=206))

"Using my visionary mnemonic, CATFAWN, can be a powerful way to immediately start using an Indigenous worldview approach to Fear, Authority, Words, and Nature with natural trancebased learning/selfhypnosis. It does not take long for the "laws of nature" to start talking to us." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=207))

## DL/PSI

**The purpose and potential of vision quests**

"Vision quests are a way to go outside ourselves to find ourselves when we are lost in some way. From them we find courage to live as cocreators with and in the world, and discover from the vision that which we needed to acquire a new level of personal power to face diffculties." ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=57))


"When neurobiology is misdeveloped, you move toward selfprotectionist mindsets and attitudes. Your vision, perception, and a%ordances (action possibilities) narrow. In order to feel safe, you have to follow scripts you've learned, something that worked in the past. !ese are governed by reactive survival systems, which are enhanced when young children are miscared for.4" ([Jacobs and Narvaez 2022:93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NYWJIUPT?page=93))

"Nonetheless, your main point is that when some humans feel they have more power than others, "they lose empathy for the less powerful and treat them as inferiors." !is, of course, is why anthropocentrism is so dangerous to the world, because humans at large feel superior to an ant, which allows less empathy for any creature that is not human."
