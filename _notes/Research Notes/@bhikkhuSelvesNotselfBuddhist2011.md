## Summary

Bhikkhu explores the teaching of Anatta, which is often mistranslated as no self. His proposition is that Buddha never taught the concept of no self, nor did he ever make any statements as to the nature of the self, be it a thing or not.

Bhikkhu's proposal is that anatta is teaching of skillful selfing and not-selfing. (not-self being different than no self, as the latter infers a nature to the thing and the former describes an action) What this means is that, as par buddha's teaching that perception is a kind of action, we can learn to skillfully perceive self and skillfully perceive not-self.

That skilfulness (or lack of skilfulness) links to buddha's teaching not touching on the nature of the self. Bhikkhu proposes that buddha saw that any attempt to define or discover the nature of the self (or no self) was a path to confusion and suffering. Since Buddha's teachings were about how to attain long term happiness (liberate ourselves from suffering)—wherein skillful actions are those that lead to long term happiness and those that do not are unskillful—any teachings on the nature of the self were counter-productive. 

Instead, buddha taught perception of self (identification, "I" making and "my" making) and not-self (disidentification) as actions that can be more or less skillfully wielded based on whether or not they serve liberation from suffering for not just ourselves, but for all beings.

In this Bhikkhu explores how the development of that skillfulness starts with learning what selves we have (as he proposes we have many, a "committee") and how to engage them in ways that help bring harmony to our inner system. That engagement means learning to self things that serve us on the buddhist path—the development of attributes of mind and behaviour—that nourish us in our capacity to not-self things that do not serve us on the path.

However, he goes to great lengths to outline how, in the same way that we might self unskilfully (such as clinging to short-term desires that compromise our long time happiness), we can also not-self unskilfully (such as disidentifiying from responsibilities for our actions and their impact on people).

Bhikkhu also outlines how this skillful self/not-selfing to support us on the path eventually gives way to us not-selfing even the path itself. However, any attempt to jump ahead to that point, to force the disposition of an awakened one, constitutes not only unskillfulness but keeps us from the path entirely. 


## Notes


##### The buddha never taught on the nature of the self, or whether or not their is one

> the Buddha, in teaching not-self, was not answering the question of whether there is or isn’t a self. This question was one he explicitly put aside—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=8&annotation=C7DQDIPL))

....  

##### The value of a question in the cultivation of knowledge and learning; some questions are skillful  

> A question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer— a sense of where that knowledge fits and what it’s good for. Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=9&annotation=G2KUMLVQ))

....  

##### The buddha had two categories of teaching: difference between skillful and unskilful actions, and the 4 noble truths 

> As the Buddha said, he taught two categorical teachings: two teachings that were true across the board and without exceptions. These two teachings form the framework for everything else he taught. One was the difference between skillful and unskillful action: actions that lead to long-term happiness, and those that lead to long-term suffering [§§4-5]. The other was the list of the four noble truths: the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path to the end of suffering [§6].—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=9&annotation=LT3HF78Z))

....  

> In terms of the first teaching, you want to avoid unskillful action and give rise to skillful action. In terms of the second, the four truths are categories for framing your experience, with each category—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=9&annotation=EFESHJFV))

....  

> You need to know which of the truths you’re encountering so that you can deal with that truth in the right way. Suffering must be comprehended, the cause of suffering must be abandoned, the end of suffering must be realized, and the path to the end of suffering must be developed as a skill—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=10&annotation=BERV2823))

....  


##### Self and Not-self as actions of identification (i making and my making) and dis-identification

> To fit into this question, perceptions of self and perceptions of not-self are best viewed as kamma or actions: actions of identification and dis-identification. In the terms of the texts, the perception of self is called an action of “I-making” and “my-making (ahaºk›ra mamaºk›ra).” The perception of not-self is part of an activity called the “not-self contemplation (anatt›nupassan›).—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=10&annotation=FI6FCSNX))

....  

\The question Buddha was exploring was not wether or not there is a self, but when is the action of identification/selfing or disidentification/not selfing skillful, and what kind of either of those perceptions is skillful.

> So, to repeat, the issue is not, “What is my true self?” but “What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful, what kind of perception of not- self is skillful and when is it skillful?”—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=10&annotation=98EIHK2T))

....  

##### Perspective on many selves discordant with each other

He outlines the committee of the mind, developed over the course of our lives, and the chaotic disposition it can get into.

> It’s as if you have a committee inside the mind, and the committee is rarely in order. That’s because it’s composed of selves you’ve collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness, and these strategies often worked at cross-purposes. Some of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude, or you weren’t really paying attention to the results you were getting—as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wanted. These members of the committee tend to be deluded. Some of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering—as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck back. These members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful: They deny the suffering they caused. This is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saints. It’s more like a corrupt city council—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=11&annotation=EUEAGIVK))

....  

##### The role of buddha's teachings is to help us bring clarity, honesty, and order to our many selves

> The Buddha’s purpose in having us master perceptions of self and not-self is to bring some clarity, honesty, and order to the committee: to teach us how to engage in these activities of perception in a conscious, consistent, and skillful way that will lead to true happiness.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=11&annotation=PELPTEX2))

....  

##### Our sense of self and not-self as activities we can do more or less skillfully 

> we can view our sense of self as an activity, a process. It’s something we do, and something we can learn to do more skillfully. At the same time we’ll look at our sense of what’s not-self—which is also an activity—and learn how to do that more skillfully, too.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=12&annotation=TKZ7V3FN))

....  
##### First chapter summary

The Buddha did not teach that there is no self. He taught how to be skillful in the issue of long term happiness, wherein questions about the existence of a self was irrelevant and at times even harmful to the alleviation of suffering. Instead, in the context of skillfulness, he taught perception as an action, and I-making and my-making as a selfing action, and disidentification as a not-selfing, and how we can learn what quality of either of these perceptions, and when to embrace them, is most skillful.  

I’m terms of self, there was discussion on how we draw and re draw lines of self and other all the time. And each of these drawn lines is like it’s own kind of self, wherein an unskillful mind is such that these many selves are discordant with each other. Developing skilfulness (in terms of long term happiness) is the process wherein we learn to bring our selves into harmony and coherence with our mind system. Which is somehow related to how and when we self or not-self.

([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH))

....  
##### All definitions of self cause suffering, but we can learn to skilfully work with our self/selves/not-self that brings about liberation from suffering  

Although all definitions of self cause suffering, and thus must be dropped to alleviate suffering, there is utility on the path to learning to work skillfully with our self/selves concept/s before we drop them.

> All of these ways of defining the self, the Buddha says, cause suffering. This is why he advises you ultimately to put them all aside. But some of them do have their uses on the path, which is why he has you develop them in a skillful way before you drop them—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=17&annotation=JWYX9DL5))

....  
##### Mastering the skills of self/not-self

Self/selves is an action—whereby ideas around true self, not self, small self etc are irreverent—what matters is only if our selfing/not-selfing is skillful and unskillful. Being that the only way to truly know a skill is to master it, mastering our skilfulness of selfing comes through practice in healthy selfing first.

> So instead of getting into a discussion as to which type of self is your true self—or your ultimate self or your conventional self—the Buddha is more interested in showing you how your sense of self is an action. The adjectives he uses to describe actions are not “ultimate” or “conventional.” They’re “skillful” and “unskillful.” These are the terms in which he wants you to understand your selves: Are they skillful? Are they not? And because skill can be understood only through mastery, the Buddha wants you to master these actions in practice.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=17&annotation=P2QTYM4V))

....  

##### Believing in inherent goodness hinders our capacity for responsibility.  

The belief that we are intrinsically good leads us to be blind to our bad actions, and thus dispositioned away from being responsible for those actions. It hinders our response-ability.  

This is different than recognizing an inherent good intention behind actions, but also recognizing the good intentions don’t erase impact or harm of actions and that’s the necessity of responsibility

> There’s also the practical concern that if you believe you’re intrinsically good, it gives rise to complacency. You believe that any intuition that rises up from a quiet mind is trustworthy. In this way, your idea of an intrinsically good self obscures your defilements. This is the opposite of what we sometimes hear— that our defilements obscure our intrinsically good nature—but if you believe your nature is intrinsically good, then when defilements arise in the quiet mind and you identify them as the wisdom of your innate nature manifesting itself, your belief in your intrinsic goodness has blinded you to what’s actually going on.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=18&annotation=AFDDITYP))

....  

> Even the idea of a cosmic self has its limitations. It prevents you from seeing how you’re actually functioning in the world and how you’re creating suffering through your I-making and my-making in the present moment. It also provides you with excuses for your unskillful feelings: Whatever arises in the mind is simply the cosmos acting through you, and you take no personal responsibility for it—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=18&annotation=L9QKG7W3))

....  

##### All definitions of the self limit us, this includes defining one as having no self.

> Every way of defining yourself also places a limitation on yourself in the sense that your definition of who you are and what belongs to you is going to conflict with somebody else’s definition of who you are and what belongs to you.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=19&annotation=37KG67UC))

....  

> When you learn how to drop these unskillful ways of creating a self—or even the idea that you have no self—you can free yourself from these limitations.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=19&annotation=N2YS7WTA))

....  
##### Creating different senses of self as tools to be used skillfully

This is also something for DL, specifically to the premise of cultivating QOAAR

> Finally, there’s a third benefit that comes from looking at the creation of a self as an action: You’re free to create different senses of self that you can use as tools. You use them when they’re needed and you can put them down when they’re not. And in fact, this is the Buddha’s strategy. This is how we create a path to the end of suffering—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=19&annotation=53HVELY4))

....  
##### This is a fun story and I like it.

Mankind waiting to ask creator for the skill of building tools, rather than having their bodies be a kind of tool (such as fish or badgers). *The moral being something to effect of the value of identifying with learning rather than defining ones identity on what is learned*

> There’s a story that illustrates this principle in T. H. White’s retelling of the King Arthur legend, The Once and Future King—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=20&annotation=5NJS66YT))

....  
##### The practices that help alleviate suffering and bring happiness are like health food to keep to mind well—which helps us wean off what keeps us unwell.

By focusing on the path, and the practices that constitute it, we are nourished as though it were a health food.

> One way we can think of the path is as health food for the mind. We need this nourishment to give the mind strength, for otherwise we wouldn’t be able to engage in the fabrication needed for the path. Ultimately, the path will bring the mind to a level of strength where it no longer needs to feed. But in the meantime, we need mental food to develop the strength and stamina needed to bring us to that point—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=24&annotation=6YC7B7ZG))

....  
We have to wean the mind onto health foods and off of sensuality, concentration practices support this process.  (*here I consider video games and other screen media*)

> To wean the mind off its usual habit of feeding on sensuality, we have to train it to enjoy the genuine health food provided by the other means of skillful clinging. This is one of the main reasons why we have to feed it with concentration—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=24&annotation=HXQB74FB))

....  
##### An example of not-self used as spiritual bypassing (to avoid acknowledging self due to self-hatred)

> This is an important point because sometimes the teaching on not-self is used as an excuse for self-hatred. In other words, “I don’t like myself, so I’ll deny that my self exists.” This is not healthy—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=25&annotation=NTRY4RGH))

....  
##### The practice of virtue develops skills that support us in overcoming addictive behaviours

> This is how the practice of virtue develops skill in learning to deal with addictive behavior. For example, suppose that you feel tempted to do something and you try to say No, part of the mind will say, “Well, you’re going to say Yes in five minutes, so why not say Yes now?” You learn how to say, “No, I’m not going to fall for that trick. What I do in five minutes is not my responsibility right now. My responsibility is what I do right now.” If you keep this up, you learn how to deal with all the tricks that the mind has to fool itself—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=28&annotation=V88YGGK8))

....  

##### Perception of an innate goodness hindering our capacity to take responsibility for our mistakes; identity based on learning helps us develop skillfulness

And an identity based on the willingness to learn encourages in us a capacity and willingness to learn, and thus to develop skilful self perception.

> In particular, however, the Buddha’s instructions here teach the most skillful sense of self to help you on the path: a self that’s always willing to learn. If your sense of pride or self-worth is built on the idea that you’re already good, you’ll have trouble learning, and trouble admitting mistakes. But if your pride or self- worth is built on the idea that you’re always willing to learn, then it opens many possibilities for developing more skill. It’s the best kind of pride there is, the most useful basis for skillful I-making and my-making—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=31&annotation=YSJU83WH))

....  

##### Genuine happiness is genuine because its origins are not in the taking from others, but come from actions that also help bring about happiness in others, too.

Any happiness that comes at the cost of another's suffering, then, is not genuine happiness. I see how this can play out in unskillful not-selfing with respect to responsibility of impact.

> In the Buddha’s eyes, one of the reasons that genuine happiness is genuine is because it doesn’t need to take anything away from anyone else, and can actually help contribute to other people’s happiness, too.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=34&annotation=CWE6Q3QI))

....  
##### The wisdom of suppression

> attitudes of modern consumer culture, but I think that it’s also a general human characteristic. We want to win at chess and keep all our pieces. That is not a healthy ego function. The wisdom of suppression lies in realizing this: that you have to sacrifice some things in order to gain what you really want. And this is what the Buddha teaches in restraint. If you see that any actions are unskillful, you learn how to avoid them for the sake of a greater happiness. It’s a trade. That’s the first healthy ego function—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=35&annotation=C4XGWFL8))

....  

##### Developing skills that serve us in rebirth

When preparing for rebirth (to die knowing that some things will be left behind and come will follow you into the next life) the practice is to develop skills in being—of good merit and of self/not-selfing—and "qualities of the mind"—such as discernment, truth, endurance, persistence etc.

> And what can you take with you? Two things. One is your actions; the other is the qualities of the mind. Traditionally, there are seven treasures you can take with you: conviction, virtue, shame, compunction, learning the Dhamma, generosity, and discernment [§31]. These are inner treasures that can carry over into the next life. Think again of going on a camping trip. One way of keeping your baggage light is by having lots of skills: knowing how to find what you need in the forest, how to forage for food, how to start a fire without matches, how to build a shelter if you don’t have a tent. In the same way, by developing these seven inner treasures you take skills with you—skills you can use—and you don’t have to load yourself down.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=41&annotation=T7IWGRDG))

....  

##### The development of merit and the cultivation of skillful selfing/not-selfing

As we cultivate actions of merit and good will, we cultivate a skillful sense of self. The consequence being and increased skilfulness of not-selfing as the benefits of this skillful selfing reveals the costs of unskillful selfing, and thus help support us more fully in skillful not-selfing 

> Notice that these lists contain the basic acts of merit: generosity, virtue, and the development of goodwill. As we have already noted, each of these meritorious actions gives lessons in developing a skillful sense of self. At the same time, each also gives practice in developing a skillful sense of not-self, for each involves giving up something of lesser worth for the sake of something of greater worth. Each requires that you see the things of lesser worth as not-self.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=41&annotation=WB6VAMQS))

....  
##### Skillful actions that carry us into rebirth applied to how we responds to selves/parts that are resistant to the actions that develop that skillfulness

Part of the development of skillful actions that we carry with us into rebirth, and into a life of enduring happiness—such as virtue or generosity—is to learn how to self/not-self in relationship to the various anti-responses of your various parts when they are confronted with the direction to take actions they otherwise (and for some good reason) are resistant to doing so.  

Whereby the elements of mind that would led us to resistant types actions are disidentifiying  with, not-self skillfully applied. And the elements we want to cultivate are identified with, self skillfully applied

> The other forms of meritorious action also teach important lessons in not-self. When you try to develop virtue, you’ll find voices in the committee of your mind that resist the precepts. You have to learn how not to identify with themand how to do it skillfully—as part of developing virtue as a treasure or a perfection.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=41&annotation=YS8TB3A5))

....  


##### Holding the really long-view of many lives and rebirths when observing life's ups and downs contextualizes them in a way that liberates the pressure of a single life time's edges.

> The Buddha also says that when you learn how to look at gain and loss over the very long-term, over many lifetimes, it helps you to overcome your attachment both to wealth and to disappointment and grief. He says to remind yourself that you have already experienced extremes of wealth and poverty many times, in many different lifetimes, so you shouldn’t get carried away with whatever wealth you have in this lifetime, or jealous of other people’s wealth, or upset about whatever poverty you fall into. Realize that material things come and go, but the state of your mind is the most important thing you have. This is how you develop the discernment to deal skillfully with whatever comes your way, both in this life and in the next—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=43&annotation=5P2GJ968))

....  
##### Turn towards to path to be nourished in a way that stops us from malnourishing ourselves of empty pleasures

Example was mice who stimulated their pleasure/electrode so much that they died of starvation... we do similar for the things in our life that we cling to but provide us no nourishment. 

Buddha helps reveal this to us and shift that clinging, but not by denouncing that which we cling to. He did so by encouraging us to turn towards the path, towards "health food" that "gives strength to the mind", knowing that doing so would naturally help us unravel our clinging without needing to resist our urges to cling as the nourishment of the path would become preferable.

> As we’ve already seen, instead of telling you simply to stop feeding on the aggregates, he has you turn them into a path: the health food that gives strength to the mind to the point where it no longer needs to feed.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=45&annotation=MZ7892QN))

....  

##### The buddhist concept of *anicca* is often translated as impermanence, but actually means something more like inconstant, unreliable, wavering.  

The buddhist concept of *anicca* is often translated as impermanence, but actually means something more like inconstant, unreliable, wavering.  

IDEA on this: [[How misunderstanding Buddhist anicca as impermanence encourages to spiritual bypassing]]

> The Pali term here, anicca, is sometimes translated as “impermanent,” but that’s not what it really means. Its opposite, nicca, describes something that’s done constantly and reliably. You can depend on it. But if something is anicca, it’s unreliable. It wavers. If you try to base your happiness on it, you have to keep tensing up around it—like trying to find some rest while sitting on a chair with wobbly, uneven legs. So when you see that even the long-term happiness of jh›na is inconstantunreliable and wavering—you realize that it’s not really all that pleasant. Even in what pleasure it does offer, there is stress. And because there’s stress, why would you want to claim it as yours?—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=47&annotation=UUPXRNB5))

....  
##### The value of asking about what questions rather than "what did you learn?"

> it’s through questions that we give shape to our knowledge: to understand how one piece of knowledge relates to other pieces of knowledge, and to figure out the best way to use our knowledge. This is why it’s important to shape our questions skillfully, for if we don’t, we give the wrong shape to everything else we know, and we won’t get the best use out of our knowledge.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=50&annotation=8ZHL9RGW))

....  

##### Not-self can also be unskillful, in the sense of when we attempt to detach ourselves from things we should be responsible for.  

> As with our various perceptions of self, our perceptions of not-self can be either skillful or unskillful. Sometimes we try to lay claim to things that we cannot control, and sometimes we try to deny that we have any responsibility for things that we can control—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=52&annotation=GALKCEXU))

....  

> the aggregates—form, feeling, perception, fabrication, and consciousness—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=52&annotation=HDZXDA2X))

....  

> Buddha’s first set of categorical teachings, to abandon unskillful actions and develop skillful ones in their place. You use the aggregates to be generous, to develop virtue, and to develop the mind through meditation.—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=52&annotation=FU2Z8ZVW))

....  
##### Questions to keep us on the path

> To do this, he recommends refining the question that lies at the beginning of wisdom: “What, when I do it, will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness?” At this stage, your sensitivity to pleasure and happiness leads you to the realization that long-term happiness is no longer good enough. It’s no longer good enough for you to want to call it “my.” So now, regardless of whatever comes up in the mind, the questions become, “Is this constant?” No. “If something is inconstant, is it easeful or stressful?” Stressful. “And if it’s stressful, is it fitting to call it me or mine?” Here again the answer is No. You apply these questions to all things, even to any perception you may have about the deathless. This is what inclines the mind to a state of unfabricated happiness. 

##### Faking awakening keeps us off the path

> What this means is that at the beginning of the path, you don’t just say that everything is not-self and leave it at that. You don’t try to clone awakening, telling yourself that “Awakened people have no desire so I’ll have no desire, too. I won’t even desire awakening. Awakened people are beyond good and evil, so I’ll go beyond good and evil, too.” This kind of thinking doesn’t get you on the path. In fact, it keeps you off the path—([Bhikkhu, 2011, p. 53](zotero://select/library/items/ILE3UXZH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNK5NB56?page=53&annotation=QIIIMQID))
