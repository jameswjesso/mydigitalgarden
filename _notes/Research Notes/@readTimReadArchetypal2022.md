##### COEX ACTIVATIONS AND CRISIS

The psyche is organized via clusters of meaning.
Those clusters are called COEX systems (a la Grof | similar to a Jungian "complex" but included the basic perinatal matrices and transpersonal content) 

Those clusters can be activated/triggered by events in our lives.
e.g. recent traumatic events can be a trigger for the emergence of material (emotional and perceptual) of an old trauma COEX.
The older back/deeper the COEX is rooted, the more energy is contained in that system. 
For example, "deep psyche" such as preverbal experiences and even birth (perinatal) experiences.

Pre-verbal/developmental triggers can be small and still have huge consequence, as in preverbal times we were entirely unguarded to both reality and to our own emotional activations. We had not yet developed the capacity to care for ourselves, self-regulate, or contextualize. Thus, small external circumstances can trigger huge reactions if they touch those deeper COEXs (and we all carry "relics of our fetal/infantile life")

The perinatal COEX systems are connected with transpersonal experiences and the archetypal realms. So when a COEX of that depth is activated it can express itself in transpersonal terms. This can be intentionally cultivated in ceremony and healing, e.g. via psychedelics and breath work. 

##### A spiritual crisis is the triggering of a perinatal COEX system wherein we are unable to make ourselves feel safe enough to process

Tim proposed that an archetypal/spiritual crisis is the triggering of a perinatal COEX system wherein we are unable to make ourselves feel safe enough to process due to a lack of contextual resources for addressing the needs/energies of the activated COEX. These are generally connected to preverbal and perinatal wounds/trauma.

And that it becomes a "crisis" when the opening of this COEX is such that it is unintentional, beyond the confines of a ceremonial container, or without the context that allows for us to enter into safe context to complete its process. We "get stuck in process"

The manifestation of this bleeding out of archetypal or transpersonal content matches the symptoms of psychosis. Wherein psychiatric interventions can work to interrupt and block the potential of *processing* the activation to completion


....

###### Processing vs In Process

When a COEX system is activates we become *in process*, which is a kind of expanded state.

Once we recognize that and begin to direct our attention to that activation with intention to assist its completion, we go from *in process* to *processing*.

Processing happens after we recognize and acknowledge that we are in process.

Usually, when we are unconsciously in process, we see the outside world as being the root cause of what we are experiencing, rather than a trigger. Once we are processing, we begin to look within ourselves for that cause, with the external trigger as a reference point.

###### The COEX processing process

- First we recognize that we are *in process*, evident by feeling like we are in an expanded state of some variety.
- Get ourselves to somewhere we fell safe (internally and externally) — co-regulation is very helpful here.
- Turn our attention inwards, recognize that the external circumstances were the trigger and not the cause of our activation.
- We begin to inquire and open ourselves about/to the big picture of what is happening within us and where it is coming from.
- This is where we can begin to integrate what happened/is happening as it allows us to disentangle the external event, our internal feeling reactions, and the root of why we feel that way —  as well as the trigger of the present and the cumulative energetic charge of the activated COEX system from the past.... 
	- This part is important because the COEX activated usually emergence limbically (without explicit association to a time/place and thus leaving it as potentially anytime/anywhere) and thus emerges as right here/right now
- Here there is a two part processing
	- Intellectual/cognitive process of inquiry, discovery, and association
	- Somatic process of moving the COEX energy through the our physical system, including with others, e.g. physical movement/dance, NEDERAs, tapping, etc.
- *** Usually, the deeper layers of our COEX system is a place where we lacked a kind of nurturing needed at the time our wounds were inflicted, and it is usually here that our practices of compassion (for others and for ourselves) really come in handy.


The expanded state of being *in process can* create an accessibility to the *processing* that allows for powerful and important healing to happen. However, if that processing does not happen then the window closes and instead of healing we just load more emotional energy into the cumulative charge of the COEX.  (And crisis emerges when we get stuck *in processing*, esp pre-verbal/perinatal material.)

Furthermore, those expanded states and our first emergence from them is a very fragile time. (esp. with respect to psychedelics/breath-work)

Also, the mindset context with, through, and by which we navigate our COEX activation determines the efficacy of the integration of the event that triggered it and/or the healing of that system that is possible.

**P** - the above processing is well assisted with things like IFS, bio-emotive (for identifying/languaging feelings), NEDERA and EMDR (both for the somatic processing).*

### Possible Interview Questions


How to tell the difference between a psychosis requiring psychiatric intervention and once requiring a pharmaceutical supportive context? Justin?

Biological psychosis vs functional psychosis?

Support vs collusion?

What about psychiatric conditions, e.g. bipolar or schizophrenia?
