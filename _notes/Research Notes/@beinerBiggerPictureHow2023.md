## Summary

Alexander explores a variety of concepts emerging out of his work with Rebel Wisdom that all point at, explore, and attempt to potentially address the "meta-crisis" as well as psychedelics in general, all through the lens of wondering where/how psychedelics fit into addressing that meta-crisis through how they might fit into a transformation of how we make sense of the world.

These concepts are couched/sewn together with reports of his experiences of DMTx (extended-state DMT). He was one of the first people in the world to experience it as a part of research being done in England. His DMTx stories work both as islands of both personal narrative and experiential reference points for linking psychedelics and psychedelic experiences to the concepts he is presenting.

The early part of the book has a lot of things that likely to be review for anyone well-read on psychedelic research, but its evident that this serves to build an important foundation for the rest of the book, which present several fresh and interesting ideas and perspective on psychedelics’ role in the modern world.

The writing is easy to understand despite rather complex topics, and at times beautiful. It does often has a dictation or blogging kind of tone to it, but never in a way that feels trite or shallow.

I really enjoyed the book and despite having encountered several of the ideas he presents in this book elsewhere (many of which from following his former Rebel Wisdom project) I still found my self engaged, inspired, and mulling over these ideas in new ways.

I highly would recommend it for anyone curious about where psychedelic can fit in the modern world beyond the limited scope of medicalization.

## NOTES

##### Making sense and finding meaning through Vervaeke reverence realization and psychedelics.  

Here he discusses relevance realization, and that its something that psychedelics help us have as it changes the scope of our perspective on things. it brings different salience, attention, and connection, which brings about realizations on what is relevant that would otherwise not have been available without that shift in the scope of our perspective.

Especially since the same process of relevance, realization can be patterned into our perception, and thus we can become stuck or rutted in certain patterns of relevance patterns of what is salient

> The idea is that human intelligence is based on our ability to determine what is *relevant* to us from all the things around us that are *salient* or calling for our attention pg 9

We can get stuck in particular patterns of relevence/salience though, a bias, and that leads us to being narrow minded and detached from our capacity to come up wth new ideas, or see things in a new way. We are all subject to this as “the same cognitive machinery, that makes you smart also makes you stupid” (pg 10). Meaning that the same cognitive machinery that allows us to dive deep and learn something can also drive us to narrow our scope and culivate close-minded bias.

Psychedelics help shake us out of those patterns, allowing for a shift in perspective and realization through shifting our salience landscape.

…

##### Integration techniques are good, but it doesn’t go very far if we live in a society that does not allows us to act on those things

> “it’s hard to reconcile a feeling of unity with the universe while you’re filling out a spreadsheet at work. And even though psychedelics may reveal to us the changes, we need to make, many of us can’t always afford to do the things we need to feel better. Not only do we need the right kinds of integration techniques – we need the right kind of society to support integration of these powerful experiences “
> 
> pg 11  

…

#### The 6 E’s of Cognition and how they relate to working with psychedelics

##### modern neuroscience sees that cognition is not solely in the brain, but is embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended

**Embody** is because our cognitive processes are inseparable from the sensory experiences of our entire physical body.

**Embedded** is because our cognitive processes are linked and inseparable from the world in which we have developed our cognitive processes. The example is given around how a whale is embedded in the ocean. It suggests that our cognitive processes are inseparable from the environmental context, in which, and through which is developed and expressed. 

**Enacted** is because our cognitive processes affect an impact the world around us, as a consequence of the actions that derive from those cognitive processes.

**Extended** is because our cognitive processes our mind is extended into the various objects we use in order to enact through action in the world. At times, a relationship to these objects become such that our cognitive process, the actions to take with those objects in the outcome of those objects in action are inseparable. The example given in the book is around, driving the car.

(pg 30)

##### According to John Vervaeke, there are two other E, emotion and expatation 

**Emotion** suggests that no cognitive process is detached from the emotional experience of the person. We are emotional beings, and even our seemingly disconnected thought processes are intertwined and informed by our emotions. As are those thoughts expressions of those emotions. As well as the feedback loop with emotional responses to those thoughts.

**Expatation** is the process by which we adapt or develop skills or functions that we did not originally evolve to have or develop use-capacities of various aspects of ourselves wherein that new use was not what the thing we are using originally evolved to be used for. His suggestion here was the tongue “which allows us to manipulate food, but was expated to allow us to speak as well. “ (pg 31 )

##### Vervaeke’s take on how the six E is relate to the work with psychedelics is found on page 32

> “because psychedelics act as such a powerful connecting agents, it may be that not only can the deepen our individual sense of *embodiment* and *embeddedness* in reality, but in turn, they can help us find new ways to *enact* changes and *extend* our cognition through one another, and our technology. “

...

##### The Meaning Crisis

Our lives have become materially affluent, but at the cost of meaning.  
This loss of meaning is the meaning crisis and there are few insituations left that provide any depth of meaning, including science.

> Science has told a story that the world is a dead machine, and human consciousness is a random fluke in an uncaring universe. (pg 42)

...

##### The difference between complex and complicated systems

Complicated systems are those that, although perhaps very intricate, are closed systems that produce a defined outcome and rely on all aspects of that system to function in a very specific way for the system itself to function at all. e.g. a grandfather clock or a car

Complex systems are open systems, interacting and embedded within other systems. There outcomes are not defined as they are nonlinear and unpredictable. In some sense you can say a complex system is alive, a forest is a complex system as is an ant colony or our bodies.

> Your body is a complex system, with millions of cells, each individually doing their thing at different levels of coordination. Some of them form a liver. Some of them form your spinal cord. All of those billions of cells, interacting together, and responding to their environment, create an organism called you. But you are much more than the sum of your parts. (pg 52)

...

##### Complex Systems and The Phenomenon of Emergence

Emergence is when new or novel expressions of phenomena come intro existence as a result of the various processes that exist within that complex system. For example, one might say that my sense of being “me” is an emergence phenomena arising out of the complex system that is my body in relationship with its environment over time.

> Perhaps the most significant and mysterious quality of complex systems is that they generate some thing known as *emergence*. Emergence is the process whereby new phenomena grow out of the interactions of complex systems. We could see emergence as a kind of creative novelty, in which new things come about not because they are designed, but because they are burst by the process of reality itself. Page 53. 

…

##### We can’t solve complex problems with complicated solutions

We can’t solve complex problems with complicated solutions. This presents why it is that are complication base thinking, will never lead to solutions for the meta-crisis. The suggestion is that psychedelics assisting in our experience of navigating complexity will assist in solving complex problems, because it increases our navigational and holding capacity for the presence of complexity, without pointing to a complication based solution

…

#### Hyperobjects

Hyperobjects are a kind of thing that is impossible to conceive of or grasp In its entirety, even though it is all around you.

The example given is that of global warming, evolution, or global plastic litter. These are things where pieces or expressions of the whole are present all around us, but, the totality of the whole is so vast that it is beyond full conceptual grasp, and thus the the wholeness of the thing becomes an object made in the mind through inference, a conceptual representative of a thing beyond the mind’s capacity to hold.

**The meta-crisis is a “hyper object made of other hyper objects“**

Beiner’s proposition is that psychedelics allow us to capacity to feel hyperobjects.

> “A hyper object is something that is all around you, but that you can’t touch or grass in its entirety.” (pg 58)

…

##### The Uncanny Valley Of Truth, and the issues on both sides of the media landscape

Page 65 to 66 presents a discussion about the uncanny valley of truth, seeking to the media, and the issues on either side of both main stream, traditional institutions and alternative media outlets, and the ruts that they both fall into.

> We're living in an ‘uncanny valley of truth seeking’. On one side, we have news, an academic institutions, and think tanks they have formed over hundreds of years. These institutions won't often cover certain stories, and get stuck in ideological ruts. Alternative media online starts filling in the gaps that these institutions can't, or that they refuse to look at. However, alternative media outlets can quickly become captured by their own bad incentive structures, and the same algorithms [Tristan] Harris has pointed to. (pg 65)

….


##### The internet is a realm of existence are being drawn into with consequences we don’t understand

We the technology of the internet grows, as does designers capacity to use intentional design to hijack our nervous systems and manipulate and/or control our attention and internet use behaviours, we are being increasingly impacted to significant consequences that we truly do not understand neither personally nor en mass.

A point of consideration he draws in here come from the old Marshall McLuhan quote “the medium is the message” which means that the structure of the medium of content we are taking in has impact on us and our thinking as much as the subject of that content. Beiner suggests that the medium of the internet, given its a platform of interaction, has become a kind of realm, or an environment onto itself.

Together, our time in that realm—due to the structure of the medium itself as well as the content we engage, the manipulative design of the technology we engage it with—impact our experience of life, our perception of things, and our behaviour. The issue is that this environment is, in many ways, toxic, and thus its impact on us—our self-perception and perception of other and the world, as well as our behaviours—can be toxic as well.  

...

##### The Internet impacts our behaviour in a similar way as the contextual element of setting in our psychedelic experiences

> We can't separate out how we are behaving from the environment that is influencing our behaviour – a situation not to similar to the role of our setting during a psychedelic experience. (pg 93)


### *I'm gonna have to re read this chapter*

…

….

##### Replace The Term “Spirit” With Unseen Other, or Those Who Are Hidden

This is in reference to Jeremy Narby’s explanation that Spirit comes from the Western concept of spiritus, which is the “unseen energy that animates a person” and represents a duality between material and nonmaterial. By calling the entities we interact with spirits we are overlaying Western concepts onto them, including a duality that doesn’t apply. Narby refers to a term “Manikari” which means “those who are hidden” and are material, and real; the animating force of living organisms, that are just not visible unless assisted by visionary plants.

Manikari as a term aside, the use of the term unseen others over spirits liberates our encounters with them from the burden of an material-immaterial duality and all the baggage that comes it it.

(pg 105)

…

##### Repressed religiosity and re-making God in The Form of a Machine

In discussing the Western world’s progressive stripping away of the so-called irrational or religious aspects of ourselves has not resulted in the removal of them, but their repression; we have repressed our relgioues urges. Like all repressed urges, though, it finds a way back to the surface through other means. It is here that he refers to writer Paul Kingsnorth exploration of this concept with respect to the place of technology and relgion in the Western world, where he suggests that our repressed beleifs in the God of Abraham are manifesting in his recreation through our technology. Where we are filling the void left in “his” absence with a new expression of his very same qualities.  

> our movement away from Christianity in the West gave us a new kind of religion. ‘We would remake earth, down to the last nano particle, to suit our desires, which are now called “needs”. Our New World would be globalized, uniform, interconnected, digitized, hyperreal, monitored, always on. We are building a machine to replace God’. (pg 115)

On page 118-119 he mentions the Jules Evans perspective that the conspirituality of Q-Anon also has very similar roots to Christian Theology.


...


##### The internet is not just a technology, but a realm onto itself (like the DMT realm)

The Internet can be seen less as a technology person entirely separate realm, similar to how we see DMT as being a separate realm.

> “The Internet need not be viewed as just a technology, but as a distinct realm – much like the DMT realm. It comes with its own rules, its own constraints, and it’s on emergent intelligence. “ (pg 125)

##### A description of The Realm of The Internet and it’s relationship to physical reality

> “The Internet has become our collective imaginal. It exists between our imaginations and physical reality. It has its own rules, and its own causality, which are different to those of the physical world. It is a place where our politics, ideologies, and religions are birthed and then breach physical reality, which in turn pushes against it in a dynamic back-and-forth. And like our unconscious desires, the more we try to repress our religious impulses, the more ferociously that will burst into physical reality” (pg 116)

##### Breach Phenomenon

“breach” is when something is developed online (or within insular cult-like pockets), existing only because of the specifics allowances of the online world, “bursts” into the physical world with results that alter the physical world is significant ways.

e.g. the capitol riots emerging out of the quasi-religious conspiracy cult of Q-Anon, the effective manipulation of Wall Street through the reddit inflation of GameStop value, or Putain’s invasion of Ukraine—” the strange rebirth of imperial Russia, Putin was heavily influenced by mythic, nationalist fantasy, dreamed up by a post- truth, Russian intellectuals to cope with the fall of the Soviet Union” (pg 117).

> Breach is what happens when a collective intelligence forms online [or in cults], then bursts into a physical reality and permanently changes its foundations. (pg 116)

##### The Language of Psychedelic Experiences Helps us Make Sense of Our Modern Times

The trans-rational language that we have learn to understand and make sense of psychedelic experiences is a kind of language that is useful in our times. This is because our time has shifted into a strangely religious kind of time. Where these religions are disconnected pockets of extremist ideas, breaching from the Internet and other echo chamber spaces into the real world, into a reality that is now clashing between breaches in a time of global crisis.

… 

##### psychedelic sensemaking the internet — flipping, blending, grounding, twisting

 This is best reviewed directly. Starting on page 121

…

##### Techniques for Conflict Conversation — Clarification of context, content, and concern

Refering to the work of Sara Ness, he outline he model for navigating conflict conversions called “context, content, and concern”

These are each different elements that can be disambiguated and spoken to/about directly, which is helpful in assisting us in keeping our conflicts from devolving into useless and unproductive fights. (the following is from Sara Ness, as quoted by Beiner)

> What we say is the content of our thoughts. However, there is always shared context going on that shifts overtime, changing the frame, goals, and understanding of what the conversation is actually about or four. And there are individual and collective concerns for each of us that define why were discussing these topics, why we care about them, and why our emotions rise and fall in relationship to each point. (Page 128-129)

…

##### A Shared Practice - Watching controversial media together

Page 130 he shared a  practice from SCHUYLER Brown, where people get together to watch a controversial piece of the media together but instead of discussing the content itself or giving their views or opinions on it, they discuss and share what they are noticing or noticed in their bodies—their sensations emotions— or the thoughts or images that came up while watching it.

…

##### Trusting the medicine during a psychedelic experience

> During a psychedelic experience, very often, the medicine holds us and gives us the courage to face discomfort; the trust we placed in this intelligence, whatever it may be, can see us through. (pg 135)


...

##### The difference between a Mystic and a Prophet (between mystical and prophetic experiences) - escapism and bypassing

The Mystic is someone who sees all reality has an illusion, including conflict and other issues. They disengage and detach themselves from the orders of the world.

The Prophet is one who's revelations and insights are explicitly about the world—often quite poltical—and arise usually from tension and conflict and confrontation with the challenges and crises of the world in their time.

In this we can see the difference between a mystical experience and a prohpetic one. The former is one where we entirely exit the cycles of the world and is oriented towards/enters a transcendant reality of oneness; the latter is one oreitned towards other, emerging out of deep confrontation with the world, perhaps even a crisis, and usually comes with a recognition of action needed, available, and possible the relieves the tension of that conflict.

The prophetic tends to lead towards greater politcal involvement; the mystical the opposite and at times results in bypassing and escapism.

(These are in reference to the work of Leor Roseman, pg 140)


...


##### Who and what is Moloch?

Moloch is the personification of the opposite of what gives life, and expresses itself in many ways, including the various behavioural traps sewn into our modern institutions and the psychopathic behaviours they incentivize.

Moloch is the personifies representation of the destructive force of our presence society. The god of extractive-consumer capitalism, negative sum games, multipolar traps, and the generally bad faith, competitiveness that drives are present society.

Latter in the book, he presents Moloch as manifest in our self-obsession with certainty, trapping us in materialism/physicalism. Trapping us in the perception that only matter and the physical is real, and deluding us to thinking that this worldview is liberating when it is really a cage that disconnects us from a deeper meaningfulness in life.

> In Chapter Two, I described how complex adaptive systems lead to emergence—that incredible, magical quality that sees novelty growing organically from the interaction of many parts. Moloch can be seen as the opposite of emergence. Moloch is entropy. Decay. Emptiness. Disconnection. (pg. 148)


…


##### The importance and Value of recognizing and integrating the shadow side of psychedelics, and the psychedelic renaissance itself

> A psychedelic future, founded on unresolved shadows is, in my view, not worth having. If we don't acknowledge the dark side of these powerful medicines and honour them within that narrative, we are doing nobody a service. (pg. 162)

…


##### Identity politics as another tool of capitalism | corporations are big on diversity and inclusion and gender identity, but not on class or equity, as the ladder would require genuine change in the form or not.

The focus and obession of idenity politcs allows for a kind of me-first division and in-fighting that prevents the kind of collabrative organization against larger issues of insitution. It also allows for organzations and coperations that propogate and profit off of the exploitive socioeconomic class-based systemic power structures by presenting as though they are a part of the solution by championing these movements, without ever needing to actually make any changes that jeoporadise their power or the institutions that enable it. This is because there is no real change needed when the debate unfolding is about idenity and acknowledgement, rather than the deeper structural issues of socioeconomic class.


> Corporations are often happy to champion diversity and inclusion, but not if that involves a redistribution of power and wealth. Marxist scholar Adolph Reed has argued that identity politics is simply another tool of capitalism. Institutions focus so heavily on identity issues because it allows them to redirect the conversation from the underlying causes of an equity, which are primarily about socioeconomic class. Solving class issues requires genuine, systemic change. Endless arguments about identity do not, and they are therefore selected by elite institutions in order to maintain the status quo. (pg 167-168)

…

..

##### Our whorship perpetual growth reflects that we have no idea what to do with transcendant experience (quote)

> Careening between nihilism and narcissism, a culture that worships perpetual growth has no idea what to do with something that transcends our egos. It becomes a lifestyle choice. We put it on Instagram. We are encouraged to cut the secret into manageable chunks so that we can microdose our way to success in a fluorescent dystopia.

….

##### The sacred is not there to make our lives better, but to dismantle us into revelation

The sacred is not a mystical parent who we look upon to get the unconditional thumbs up for who we think we are and what we believe. It is not a tool of lifestlye optimization. It is a force beyond us that undoes us, that we surrender onto as it confront ourselves and reveal to us delusions we hold about whats what and why. Hopefully, to the result of learning.

> Psychedelics can reliably elicit an encounter with the sacred, but that encounter is not what we expect. What countless shamanic and spiritual traditions teach us is that the sacred is not there to make our lives better. It is not there to confirm our warped, ideologies or for us to post on Instagram for a fleeting hit of dopamine. The sacred is there to shred us. It guides us to the depth of ourselves to find out to find our own delusions, and to dispell them. ([age 180-181)

…

##### Moloch in causation vs correlation in brain imagery/subjective experience

Considering brain/psychological activey as being the source of subjective experience—e.g. that the brain produces subjective experience—is a confusion of correlation with causation. What is certatinly true is that brain activty and subjective experience is correlated, and reasonable observations and assumtptions can be made from that foundation, but any conclusions about one’s subjective experience based on brain activty as cause is founded on a false assumption.

This links back to his discussion about Moloch being expressed through our self-obsession with certainty as manifest in materialism/physicalism. In this case, manifest through the proposition that subjective experience is a result of—caused by—physical processes, and is thus subjective experiences is less relevent in the formulation of conclusions about what is being observed than the physical observations.

However, brain imagery and the mapping of a physical experience only shows us one dataset. It does not reveal subjective experience, and is thus incomplete if not integrated with the reports of subjective experiences.

This can result in false hypotheses.

E.g. a mystical experience is an epi-phenomenon of brain processes and anything thus perceived is also the result of one’s brain, and thus *just* entirely subjective projections of the brain, aka hallucinations or fantasy.

The latter is also true, this case cannot be made any more reasonably than saying that something is objectively real simply because I experienced it subjectively. However, the former is institutionally recognized as reasonable and the latter unreasonable. This is Moloch.

> I can't come back from a psychedelic experience and make a definitive claim that the entities I saw were real. Likewise, the team at Imperial can't look at the brain images while I'm under DMT and say, ‘what we’re seeing is your experience.’ What they are observing are neurological correlates of my experience: what's happening in my brain while I am in an altered state. Saying that they are observing my experience would be like claiming that the week left by a boat is, what's causing the boat to move. (pg 187-188)


....

##### In considering what brain imagery research tells us about the psychedelic experience

Ultimately, brain imaging research tells us what is happening in the brain during a psychedelic experience. It doesn't, actually, really, tell us anything about the experience itself, other than it's neurological correlates.

> This is important data, but scientists aren't actually measuring the psychedelic experience itself. They are measuring the neurological correlates of a subjective experience. (pg 193)

And thus, this data set, although, useful and interesting in many respects, cannot tell us anything about what those changes mean for the person experiencing the psychedelic substances. Because of this, there is various forms of interviews and surveys that help the subject to reveal to the scientists and researchers what happened subjectively. From those subjective reports, they attempt to interpret and draw conclusions about what the neurological activity means insofar as the subjective experience being had. And although this data is interesting, it doesn't necessarily reveal to us what it is about psychedelic experiences that cause such profound transformations in self identity and perspective. (this links back to _____)

> It's an important process, but it is by no means the most interesting, or useful way to understand how psychedelics change our perspective. (pg 193)


…


##### A psychedelic-shift towards animism might change society, but only if we integrate it into our institutions

In discussing the research that shows people having an increased perception of consciousness in non-human life, including plants and fungi, there was a proposition that such a change in us could correlate/lead to positive changes in our insitutions and their effect on the earth through a shift in how we enage non-human life.

He presents this as possible both through using our perceptions of the intelligence expressed through consciousness of non-human life as examples for repatterning insutitions into greater sustainability—e.g. modeling insutatiions off of mycelial behaviour—but also due to the result of culitvating a relationship with non-human consciousness that acknowledges them in our system—e.g. New Zealand granting the Whanganui river personhood under the pretense that it is not all that different than granting coperations personhood, which we have already legally done.

> One way to ensure that these animistic awakening slowly to real systems, changes to combined psychedelic insights with biology and policy. […] fungi can give us a blueprint for a much deeper pattern in nature – a pattern of interconnected, supportive networks. […] We don't even have to stretch our current physical with definitions of consciousness very far to recognize that fundraisers and plants are conscious.
> 
> …
> 
> And if we change our conception of consciousness, so that non-human consciousness is as important as human consciousness, we can begin to change our legal system to match this view. (pg 217)

However, those psychedelic-induced changes in our perception of non-human life don’t amount to much is we don’t integrate them into our lives and society.

> It's worth noting that, even if psychedelics can change the majority of people's perception of reality, this isn't enough by itself. As a Luna points out in response to the increased number of people, taking psychedelics and opening up to a more animist perspective, "what matters is what you do with that experience. What is your vision, your relationship with your family, with your neighbors, with your society, with your garden, with the world? If it has changed, great; if not, it's all just narcissistic, like going to a good film. A very special film, but that's all.” (pg. 217)

## Possible Podcast Directions

One possible direction is to ask him questions about his experiences with the NTX specifically DMTX specifically  

When the introduction page 15, he asks “how can psychedelics help us find solutions to the existential crisis you’re facing as a species?“

One of the things you mentioned is that the way that we will address this crisis is not just what we do but how we do it can you remind why are you feel the attention to the how is so important?

Page 10 on how the same cognitive machinery, that makes you smart also makes you stupid. There’s a question hear about intelligence and wisdom, and the difference.

Impossible question about his experiences in the extended state DNT and whether or not at this point, he believes that he was in countering, separate and intelligent entities?

question. Something that might be interesting would be to just identify a handful of the concepts. He presented his books, I have each of them be a question.

There is a question here with respect to what is the meta-crisis, what does it have to do with complexity, and why do psychedelics offer us a potential to address it in a way that leads to solutions

is there a difference between complex and complicated?

You present in your chapter between realities, comparing the Internet to Psychonaught Realms.

Question what are your thoughts on the emergent presence of ai? Something that was not so prominent when you were writing this book.
