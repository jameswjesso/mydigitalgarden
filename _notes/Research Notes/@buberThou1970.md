## Summary

##### Love is not our feelings of love; love does not dwell in man; man dwells in love

> Feelings accompany the metaphysical and metaphysical fact of love, but they do not constitute it; and the feelings that accompany it can be very different. Jesus' feeling for the possessed man is different from his feelings for the beloved disciple; but the love is one. Feelings one "has"; love occurs. Feelings dwell in men, but man dwells in his love. There is no metaphor but actually: love does not cling to an I, as if You were merely its "content" or object; it is between I and you. Whoever does not know this, no this with his being, does not know though, even if he should describe it to the feelings that he lives through, experiences, enjoys, and expresses. Love is a cosmic force.
