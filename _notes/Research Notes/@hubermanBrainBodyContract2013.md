## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This was from the Huberman live show in Toronto. Alysha and I attend on Sept 12, 2023. The key takeaways were about managing stress/relaxation such that one increases their capacity for navigating life and its complexities; neuroplasticity and learning as something enabled by effectively managing the stress/relaxation process; and practices that can increase creativity

### Stress

##### Sleep is the central mediator of stress recovery

As long as you can sleep, you can stress as much as you like

That the long-term damage of stress on the body and mind is negliable if you are able to sleep well.

##### Stress mobilizes resources

Stress is not a bad thing. It is the process by which the body triggers the mobilization and distribution of resources throughout the body to meet the demands of the stressor. It is something that unchecked and uncompensated for with sleep will prevent your body from replenishing those resources, eventually burning you out and causing damage.

##### The 3 things you need to be able to do to live well with stress

1. Control stress in real-time  -- (to be able to bring one down from stress if needed. The key item in doing this that he shared with the physiological sigh)
2. Raise your stress threshold -- (this is down by intentionally doing things that raise stress hormones in your body, things you do not like the experiences of, such that the body is able to slowly acclimatize to the presence of stress hormones so that when they are triggered in other circumstances we are able to move with them more coherently. e.g. cold exposure, cyclic hyperventilation)
3. Fall asleep when you need to -- (he didnâ€™t explain how, only that the ability to simply fall asleep whenever you need to is part of the importance of sleep to restore and rebuild after stress, and in general)

##### The physiological sigh down shifts the nervous system

Each sigh works to lower sympathetic activation and increase parasympathetic activation. Thus, we can use it to bring ourselves out of high states of stress, but also to push ourselves into states of sleepiness/relaxation, e.g. sleep.

### Neuroplasticity & Learning


##### Neuroplasticity requires two things

- Access to high attentional states (and it doesnâ€™t matter how one accesses these states, just that they do)
- Sleep (or NSDR, but sleep ideally)


Like building a muscle, we exercise to stress the muscle, then the building happens in repair. Same for neuroplasticity, in the high attentional states we are pushing our brain towards a disposition, and it is in rest that neural pathways we are pushing them into are built up. It is in the rest that the brain is doing its rewiring.

##### Learning is a process of neuroplasticity

The process of learning something is the process of rewiring the brain to accord for that which is being learned. This means that, like neuroplasticity generally, the learning happens in rest/sleep afterwards.


##### Agitation and frustration are ideal states for learning

The frustration and agitation of attempting to learn or develop a thing, the struggle of it, is an ideal place to be for learning. The error signals that come up as we struggle to understand or accomplish something are akin to the pain and challenge of lifting something heavy in a workout. And, whereas our strength is then developed after the pain and struggle of the heavy lift is over, and we are in rest, the same is true for learning. 

We struggle and get frustrated and agitated, and then we rest, and it is in that rest that the learning happens, such that the next time we enter into those ideas or that thing we are attempting to learn, the brain-muscle of the learned thing is stronger.

However, this requires that we perceive the struggleâ€”agitation and frustrationâ€”as a part of the process. As something good and worth pushing through, as a part of the learning. If we do not, then the subjective interpretation of that struggle will block our learning process by compromising the perceived value of the effort and subsequent behaviours. 

This related to [[we learn by making mistakes, not by getting things right]]

##### NSDR to assist in neuroplasticity and learning

Being that sleep or NSDR or sleep are essential in the neuroplasticity/learning process, we can intentionally use NSDR after bouts of intense focus to help assist the learning process.

5-20min of NSDR, as relaxed and as still as possible.

##### NSDR requires one to get as relaxed and still as possible

In order to get into the benefits of the NSDR, one needs to be able to be as still as possible in the practice.

(This is something that has been tough for me due to pain, but I am getting better are suppressing the urge to move until it is quieter)

### Creativity

##### Stillness as a creativity practice

Huberman presented that a growing hypothesis he has atm is that absence of stimuli, including that of movement stimuli, is something that can increase creativity. For example, Rick Ruben (who is considered one of the most creative people in the world) spends hours a day just laying still and looking at nothing.

Huberman offered this laying still and looking at nothing as a kind of creativity practice. This is not meditation, not trying to focus on breath or sensation or witnessing or a particular anything. Just laying there, still, and letting whatever thoughts come up do so however they do.

Essentially:

- relax the body
- alert the mind
- perfectly still

His presentation was what when still, the resources that would be for movement are allocated elsewhere and, when there is no other stimuli, the alert mind will start to make things up to stay active/engaged with something.

### General/Other

##### Body part crowd work

This was a presenter practice.  
He asked the crowd to give him a body part, and he would share something he found fascinating about that body part.

##### Body titled relative to gravity while accelerating feels good

He mentioned that there is s flush of satisfaction and rewards molecule when one is titled relative to gravity while accelerating. This is something mediated by the inner ear.

This is insightful given my love of [[rollerblading]]

##### Living a life that feels good

Keep an eye out for moments of delight that seems to be connected to similar moments of delight from childhood. Those are like guiding lights towards things in life that will nourish our sense of life feeling good.

##### Time space bridging meditation practice

Huberman shared his meditation practice.

He moves his attention from deeply internal to widely external.

	Starting from observing his inner experience with eyes closes, to eyes open, to observing what's in front of him, to what's beyond that, to eventually extending his attention to observing the whole planet in his mind and then back again.

Apparently, this helps with task switching.  
Also, that this process also manipulates time slicing, where the more internal one is the finer the slice and vice versa.

He recommended the secret pulse of time.

##### Time slicing

Time slicing is the frame rate at which the brainâ€™s perceptual process is rendering rates of change.  
The more thin sliced time, the longer an amount of time feels subjectively and vice verse

Blinking is involved here, wherein each time you blink your perception of time is reset (link to blinking article)

##### Visual context alters nervous system activation

Panoramic vision is calming  
Focused vision is stimulating
