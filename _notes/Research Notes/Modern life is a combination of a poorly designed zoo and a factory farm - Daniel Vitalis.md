## Modern life is a combination of a poorly designed zoo and a factory farm - Daniel Vitalis

I don't have an exact citation, but I heard Daniel Vitalisâ€”re:wilding advocateâ€”repeatedly refer to humans having been made fragile by our adapting to the domicile (being domesticated) while our domicile was itself poorly designed for human wellbeing. Thus we are maladapted to the world outside of our domestic enclosures.

If we consider chimpanzees, and their environmental needs as an animal, it would be outrageous to think that they would remain healthy and flourishing if their zoo environment was a box, inside a box, with plain walls, no plants, nothing to climb on, detached from the environment outside that box, and mostly isolated from other chimpanzees. 

We humans, although we are not chimpanzees, have evolutionarily-adapted needs for certain environmental factors that support us in our overall health and wellbeing and the design of our modern lives and the house/interior and external/social environments we tend to spend the bulk of our time in not only lacks the presence of those factors but often is contradictory to the needs those factors would otherwise satisfy.

His overall observation in this respect is that modern societyâ€”and the modern domicileâ€”amounts to a weird combination of a poorly design zoo and a factory farm.

The factory farm reference being that, given the values and constructs of the socioeconomic engine of the modern world, humans are a free range livestock being bred for our labour. 

Grim, I know.
