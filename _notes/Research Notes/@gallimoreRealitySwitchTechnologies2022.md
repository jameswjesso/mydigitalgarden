### 1. Other Worlds

##### Every experience is "real"

Gallimore proposes that psychedelics experiences are not hallucinations in the sense that they are not real. They are real, as the fact that we experience them makes them real experiences. However, real in experience and really what exists beyond our inner experience are not necessarily the same thing.  

This was also spoken to in [[@grayHowPsychedelicsCan2022#The Primacy Of Experience ...|D.McKenna's chapter in how psychedelics can help save the world]], he called it the [[primacy of experience]] 

> Of course, this doesn’t mean that the fearsome Reptilian Overlord encountered at the peak of a DMT trip exists anywhere outside of your experience, but within your experience it most certainly exists. Whether it continues to exist after the trip ends is another question entirely.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=10&annotation=JVGL2R5N))

##### The brain as a world building machine and psychedelics are the tools to tune and operate it

> Your brain is the most complex structure in the known universe, and the world-building machine *nes plus ultra*. And psychedelic molecules are the tools for tuning and operating this machine.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=11&annotation=8X735G3B))

### 2. The World-Building Machine

##### The phenomenal vs the noumenal, modeling perception

Kant: the phenomenal world is the world we experience subjectively through our internal world building mechanism (perceptual system into modeling system into experience).  

The noumenal world is what is external to use that our perceptual/modelling systems build into the world as we know it.  

We can never truly know what the noumenal world is as we can only experience it as phenomenal. We never have direct access to the information of the noumenal as whatever signal in the noise of that raw information is always being rendered into a construct experienced subjectively

> German philosopher Emmanuel Kant distinguished between the subjective experience of an object, which he termed the phenomenon, and the unknowable thing-in-itself, independent of our perceptions, which he called the noumenon—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=17&annotation=2ZBVQ9IL))

....  

##### The "consensus world" as an evolutionarily advantageous adaptive model of reality 

The consensus world is the world that we have evolutionarily developed as an adaptive rendering of the external world, such that it allows us to survive.  

An adaptive model, accurately reflective enough of the outside world to enable effective survival navigation of it, wherein those models are shared (enough) amongst each other for us to collectively navigate them (to more or less degree depending on the subtly of meaning on that particular thing we are modeling with each other)

> your brain has learned to construct a model that allows you to navigate the environment, distinguish between predators and prey, find a mate, and generally to survive to pass on your genes to the next generation. In evolutionary parlance, this is an adaptive model. We’ll refer to the normal waking phenomenal world, functioning as an adaptive model of the environment, as the consensus world.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=18&annotation=9NNKFW4S))


....  


##### Real vs unreal is tricky, Adaptive models of the environment as a better language

Real vs unreal is tricky and slippery

Phenomenal is always real as all of reality as we will ever know it is always a model experienced phenomenally … which doesn’t necessarily make claim about whether or not your phenomenal experience is an accurately adaptive model of your environment

> But we must avoid the unhelpful, and ultimately confusing, temptation to try and divide the contents of your phenomenal world into the “real” and the “unreal”. Your phenomenal world is always a model and it’s always built by your brain.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=18&annotation=P6XVYLVY))

....  


##### All experienced (phenomenal) world is real, but not all experienced worlds are adaptive models of the environment  

> So, in a sense, all phenomenal worlds are equally real in that they’re all built by the brain. However, not all phenomenal worlds are adaptive models of the environment.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=18&annotation=BG86NIID))

....  

##### Every experience is a model, every model experienced is real, but not every experince is an adaptive model

Ala [[@grayHowPsychedelicsCan2022#The Primacy Of Experience ...|Mckenna's]] primacy of experience, anything we experience is real. However, it being real does not necessarily mean that it is an adaptive model (e.g. representing the outside world in a manner effective for survival navigation of it.)

> Your brain has no yardstick by which to measure the truth or reality of its world model—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=19&annotation=KXRICCQ5))

....  

##### Psychedelic molecules alters the functioning of the brain's world building mechanisms, changing the experience of the world.

> When a psychedelic molecule finds its way into your brain, it changes the structure and dynamics of its world model.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=19&annotation=TGD3N9TN))

....  

##### Information is signal generated out of noise

Information is the signal generated out of noise. Information is what is generated when potentiality is collapsed into bits of specificity out of uncertainty.

> Formally, information can be defined as the opposite of uncertainty—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=20&annotation=JQ63U4IG))

....  


##### The brain generates information by selecting signal from a larger pool of potential signal, then renders that information into our experience of the world

Presenting how the brain, like an informational system such as binary code, is able to generate information (e.g. making signal out of noise, making information out of uncertainty) from a vast domain of potentiality (reality) and then process that information into the phenomenal world.

It does so by selecting out of a vast potential into a defined set, the selection pattern being informed by evolutionary adaptation (e.g. adaptive models of the environment enabling sensory registration that leads to survival)

> In general, any system that can select from a large number of states can generate large amounts of information. This includes the brain, which generates inordinate amounts of information by selecting from an extremely large number of possible states. Every time your brain selects a single state from its repertoire of potential states, it rules out vast numbers of alternative states and thus generates vast amounts of information. And, it is this information that manifests as your phenomenal world.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=23&annotation=MHN99CC7))


......  

##### Each neuron is a decision tree for generating information through selective activation/non-activation, which cascades across the brain through various connection points, sculpting certain patterns of activation over others

The brain is able to generate information out of the potentiality/uncertainty of the unfathomable complexity of reality through its concentric networks of trillions of decision tree points that either excite/fire or don’t, which cascade across the brain and collectively engender various brain states.  

(Each state is not just a subjective state of mind or being—like happy, sad, tripping, drowsy, etc—but even the activation correlated to the perception of a colour is included as a state, let alone the entire complexity of realty)  

These activation/Non-activation patterns (and there association with various brain proteins, transmitters, etc) sculpt the brain overtime wherein paths of connection within and between different systems/networks within the brain get better or worse at generating various states.  

...

The brain contains a vast number of neuron and synapses connecting them, in a ready state of action potential. Through its integrated system, individual neuron and the synapses connecting them go through a process of firing or not firing electrical signals that, dependant on the rest of the systems fire/no fire decision and the consequential (and contributing) neurochemical environment of that synapses, waves of activity/inactivity throughout the various networks of the brain result in the generation and processing of information. Which is to say that it creates various states of activation/inactivation as an expression of information generation.

Wherein, the physical and functional connections between and within those networks can be modulated or sculpted (strengthened or weakened) in accordance with the frequency of their activation.

> Much of the brain’s ability to generate information, perform complex computations, and generally control the flow of information through its networks is afforded by these synapses. The sculpting of synaptic connections allows the cortex to sculpt the patterns of information it generates and, ultimately, it’s this information, generated by trillions of action potentials per second and processed through the cortical networks, that manifests as your phenomenal world.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=37&annotation=3HKVFKIA))




....  

##### The cortexes capacity to generate incredible amounts information giving rise to a rich subjective world


> This richness and detail in your phenomenal world is only possible owing to your cortex’s ability to generate almost inexpressibly vast amounts of highly structured information.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=38&annotation=8BSVC9BH))

....  

##### The number of columns 

> The overall state of the cortex is thus the pattern of active/inactive states of all its columns. Assuming (and, again, simplifying) that each column is independent and can freely select from its active or inactive states, the total number of distinct states the cortex could adopt is around 2100,000,000, which is—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=39&annotation=ZF4BF3ZB))

....  

##### What I am understanding from this is a simplified version, of a simplified generalization of something with vast complexity and much greater mystery yet to even fathom

This process, however is extremely vast and even my above attempt to make sense of what is being shared with me is more of a generalization of a recapitulation of a generalization than any kind of accurate explanation of the brain.

> a number so unimaginably massive as to be practically infinite (ask your calculator if you don’t believe me). Every moment of your conscious life, your brain selects a single one of these states and generates all the information that constitutes your phenomenal world at that point in time.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=41&annotation=J9H26T85))

....  

##### Feeling a sense of wonder while reading

Really feeling a sense of wonder and mystery reading this and knowing not only will I not be able to grow this now, but the actual extent of what is being spoken to here is, itself, perhaps beyond capacity to grok. Thus, my wonder at the vastness of this, although far from hat is already knowable and known by even the author of this book, let alone many many others likely beyond him, the experience of its beyondness is still linked to the beyondness of it even in the minds of those who know and grok much more on the topic than I.  
Goddard, the brain. Wow.

##### A particular state activated in the brain in response to the perception of a thing, is the state one is in

(Questions here about internal vs external contribution to states, e.g. a tree to a happy person vs a depressed person)

> Your subjective experience of the object is the information generated by the adoption of that particular state—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=43&annotation=ZLAKANKA))




### 3. The Consensus Reality Space I (Fundamentals) 合意的現実空間:1



....  
Cool quote and wondering about his thoughts on atasoy’s work
He knew of it, not seemingly that interested when I brought it up.

> Every moment is a unique pattern of cortical column activation, a single state of the cortex selected from a practically endless repertoire of possible states, manifesting as the richly informative and irrevocably subjective experience of a world—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=46&annotation=UQ8HRLVZ))

....  

##### Baseline waking reality is a model of our environment

Baseline waking reality is a model of our environment. That same world building system is able to render information into perception of a reality without input from the environment as well. Such as in dreams, or through an altered function of our system that leads the brain to render our model of the environment in a very different way than our baseline

> Your normal waking phenomenal world is a model of the environment.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=46&annotation=WV6YFNWK))

....  

##### Why we never experience objects of perception as isolated element of perception, but as a subjective whole—neuronal level

Individual neutrons are organized into kinds of columns, which are linked within systems within the brain. These links are the brain’s connectivity—the connections between and within columns across the various structures of the brain—which accord for why our subjective experience is never of an isolated factor of perception but a whole constructed out of various parts (his example was how we never experience the strawberry red without its bulbous shape too)

> In fact, your entire phenomenal world is bound to form a unified, indivisible, structure. This is only possible owing to the massive interconnectivity of your cortex—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=47&annotation=IT7A7BIB))

....  

> There are broadly two types of inter-column connections: direct and indirect connections—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=47&annotation=VAZYWAIB))

....  


##### The thalamus as a rely station and mini map of and for the brain, all cortico columns have a synaptic connection to it.

> The thalamus is often described as a relay station — or gate — through which all sensory information must pass on its way to the cortex (5). However, this is only one of its roles — the thalamus has also been described as a miniature map of the cortex, since every column is reciprocally connected to its own corresponding region of the thalamus—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=49&annotation=V7KU2F2J))

....  


##### A simple description of the variable of patterns and noise of our environments and the brains generation of information and rendering of an adaptive model

> Naturally, this sensory in- formation is not random: the environment is rife with regularities and patterns and, as such, so is the sensory information received by the senses. Of course, there is also a lot of irregularity and noise in the patterns of sensory information, and the brain’s role in perception is to extract the regularities from the noise.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=56&annotation=CY5T3R9W))

....  


##### The sculpting of the brain, physical and functional pathways, as a kind of learning in relationship to our environment over time

The brain is sculpted overtime (learns) to develop the physical and functional connectivity that supports the states that correlate with (learned) adaptive models of our environment.  

This sculpting equates to a kind of contracting into particular states over others. This is never static, though, and continues to evolve over time. (Although I suspect that the natural rigidity of aging as well as trauma/stress induced rigidity limit those changes)

> In the same manner, by continually sampling patterns of sensory information from the environment, the cortex sculpts the connections between the columns and, ultimately, learns to construct a dynamic, adaptive, and functional model of the environment in its entirety—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=56&annotation=ZMBJFRTU))

....  

##### The evolved brain as something that has effectively selected the states necessary for both rendering an adaptive model of the environment and that model fitting within Consensus Reality

> The evolved brain, in contrast, by sculpting its connectivity, has effectively selected the states that represent a functional model of the environment — it has contracted its state space to only those states within the Consensus Reality Space. This is analogous to tuning an old TV set—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=58&annotation=QK4WW8R8))

....  

##### The world-model is never finished

> Firstly, it’s important to note that the world model is never finished, but is updated and refined continually — from the moment you emerge from the womb until your inevitable demise, your brain is continually sampling sensory information to sculpt and refine the connectivity that defines the model.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=58&annotation=BZMKAGDR))

....  

##### The world building systems patterns in dreams is untethered from the environment

The guiding factor of our world building in dream states is memories, emotions, and random fluxes rather than our environment, even though the learned models being used to render that dream world are the same.

> As a result, the flow of states becomes erratic, guided not by the patterns of sensory information, but by emotion, memories, and even random fluctuations in cortical activity—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=59&annotation=UCACXBVX))



### 4. The Consensus Reality Space II (Deep) 合意的現実空間:2

....  

##### Complex Systems vs Complicated Systems

In contrast to complicated systems that require intentional design to maintain its function

> Complex systems, in contrast, self-organise from their components without any central controller, their behaviour emerging from their interactions—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=62&annotation=YS527F9M))

Out of complex systems on the edge of chaos

> life is not a property of matter, but a process that emerges from its interactions.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=62&annotation=6I9LECJR))

....  

##### Information is generated based on the brain predicting what is happening and selecting based on that prediction, then altering it's predictions as necessary

How the brain determines what is important out of the complexity of the environment is to use our world model to predict what will happen, and then check it against what actually happened, and filter out what it got right and absorb and process what it got wrong (part of the necessity of learning to continue adapting)  

This also helps to reserve the energy expenditure of brain function.

> The brain employs a conceptually simple principle to distinguish between sensory information it must absorb and process and that which it can discard: 1. The brain uses its world model to predict the sensory information it will receive in the following moment. The brain is constantly trying to predict what will happen next, based upon what it thinks is happening now.  
> 2\. Any sensory information that is correctly predicted is extinguished (filtered out). Only the sensory information that the brain fails to predict — surprising information — is ab- sorbed and processed (4).—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=65&annotation=4CC9YT6J))

....  

##### The building up of prediction errors forces the brain to update its models

Something here about how the error is something that psilocybin helps generate in the re meaning process of healing—already linked to DL

> The cortex continually compares its predicted sensory input with the actual sensory input and only the difference between them — a prediction error — is processed. It’s these errors that can be used to update and correct the model.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=65&annotation=CK4QHW6S))

....  

##### The predictive top-down hierarchal process of visual perception

The rending of visual really goes through statues of hierarchical complexity, the lowest nested within the higher, from the most basic elements of vision into V1, which are identified and modelled as something such as a shape (e.g. triangle) into V2, and v2 elements are rendered into gene higher levels of coherent complexity in V3, e.g. face, or book shelf.  

We learned to quickly use predictive modelling to be able to jump straight to face without having to process lines int hopes and shapes into faces.

> Whilst the pattern of activity in V1 is the sensory information being predicted, the objects that you experience and recognise are the nested object representations spanning many levels of the cortical hierarchy—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=70&annotation=EGCIZWCZ))


> So, rather than trying to predict the sensory information from these five objects independently, it can treat them as a unified set of objects—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=72&annotation=Y9AA6LKX))

....  

##### Why we are so likely to perceive faces in objects without faces

We see faces in objects without faces because of the predictive modelling process our brains undergo in order to limit resource consumption; which is the categorization of visual stimuli into higher order constructs so as to then project those higher order constructs/representations over reality as predictions, only expending resources to check further than the predicted construct if there is sufficient error signal to suggest the prediction is false. Because faces generally are an important construct to be able to recognize for evolutionary reasons, the brain has a high prioritization for facial recognition and is likely to jump to that prediction.

> If you’ve ever seen a face in the clouds, or burnt into a slice of toast, you’ll have experienced this first-hand. Pareidolia — the experience of seeing familiar objects (often faces) in inappropriate places — is an expression of the brain’s constant attempt to find patterns in sensory information that it can categorise into familiar objects. And faces are one of the most important types of objects that your brain has evolved to recognise and represent — so it’s not overly surprising that people will often find them in even the most random patterns that occur in the environment.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 53](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=73&annotation=YIW5CC7N))

....  

##### The brain doesn't and can't attempt to make its representations correct or true, only to reduce prediction errors 

The brain can never know if it’s representations are true or correct, only whether or not it is the best representation in the sense that it minimizes predictions errors as a well as serves an adaptive model and thus navigation of reality, as led by our evolution as a species.

> No matter how accurate its predictions might be, the brain can nev- er know whether the object representation it’s selected to model a particular pattern of sensory information is somehow “correct” or “true”. The best object representation is simply the one that best predicts the evolution of sensory information and minimises the prediction errors—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 53](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=73&annotation=DFS7CC3J))

....  

##### The brain renders reality from the top down through predictions, hypotheses

Predictions are hypotheses and they are happening in a top down fashion, but these hypotheses are happening at all levels, and if errors occurs they are checked downward until enough errors generate the necessity of either modifying or completely altering those hypotheses

> Different hypotheses generate different predictions that flow down the cortical hierarchy. From the top downwards, each lev- el of the hierarchy is generating predictions about the activity in the level below. If these predictions fail to match the actual activity, prediction errors are generated.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=74&annotation=7FYZI2DS))

....  

##### A summary of the hypothesis and prediction error process in our brains world building mechanism’s

The top down flow of predictions is always working against the upward flow of prediction errors

> Each hypothesis generates predictions that flow down the hierarchy in a never-ending fight against the upwards flow of prediction errors. In other words, the world model, built from hypotheses, is constantly being tested against sensory information. Prediction errors — the only information that flows up the cortical hierarchy — are both essential and dangerous. Without them, the cortex would be unable to detect when its world model was failing to model the ongoing events in the environment whilst, conversely, an untrammelled flood of information would threaten to overwhelm the cortex, making it difficult to navigate and make sense of the world.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 56-57](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=77&annotation=7YZYBLY9))

### 5. The Consensus Reality Space III (Technicalities) 合意的現実空間:3

##### Perception flows down from higher-order representations, checked against sensory information, not upwards from sensory information checked against representations

Perception doesn’t flow upwards from sensory information to representation, but more so the other way around, where the representation hypothesis is first predicted at the top level conception and then checked against sensory information down the hierarchy towards the most raw sensory data, wherein errors in those predictions triggers changes to the hypothesis as needed.  
…  

> The classical approach to explaining perception is that sensory information flows up the cortical hierarchy, with each level ex- tracting features of the information and using it to piece together a world model. However, notice how this standard bottom-up ap- proach is reversed. Each level of the cortical hierarchy actually generates its own “level” of the hierarchical model, which it uses to predict the activity in the level below, which also generates its own, lower-order, level of the model. Each level of the cortical hier- archy then adjusts its level of the model such that its predictions accurately predict the activity in (the model being generated by) the level below.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=88&annotation=W56IPWUZ))

> The model is being generated, not in a bottom-up fashion driven by sensory information, but in a top-down fashion driven by the cortex’s high-order hypotheses—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=88&annotation=UHXUZJ5K))

....  

##### the sculpting process constrains the brain's repertoire for potential states to those that are most evolutionarily adaptive 

The  sculpting process that the brain undergoes constrains — defined/confined — the potential repertoire of brain states (and thus phenomenal worlds) to those that model reality in a way evolutionarily functional and adaptive to the environment.  

This is not necessary the most real or truest model, it's the most adaptive

> By sculpting its connectivity, the cortex has constrained its state repertoire to a small region of the cortical state space — the Consensus Reality Space — containing those states that represent a useful and functional model of the environment.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=99&annotation=KR5IYFWA))

### 6. The World Space 世界空間

##### DMT is an entirely different reality channel that that of Consensus Reality

DMT space is a different reality channel than consensus reality space as a consequence of the alteration of our world building mechanisms from their default rendering towards something else.

> The DMT space is not an alternate or distorted version of the consensus world, but another reality channel entirely. However, just like the normal waking world, it is a model constructed by the cortex, as all phenomenal worlds must be.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=102&annotation=57Y3XSQZ))

##### That our psychedelic perceptions aren't adaptive models of baseline environment, doesn't mean they aren't of external reality in some way

However, this being the case does not necessarily suggest that what is being encountered is only in our own heads and not reflective of some "free standing" external reality, nor does it suggest that it isn't.

> Although it must remain an open question as to whether these strange realms are a model of some kind of freestanding external reality or, as many prefer to assume, a pure cortical fabrication—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=102&annotation=Z3YRS9SC))

##### The world space is the finite set of potential column activation states in the cortex capable of generating one sense of the world.

The world space is the finite set of potential columns activation states in the cortex capable of generating one sense of the world. This is finite in the sense that only so many variations of activation can produce a sense of the world, however the number of the variations are so vast it’s incalculable

> since each state represents your entire world at any moment, we’ll refer to this state space as the World Space—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=103&annotation=N9BSA2YW))

##### Consensus reality is a subset of potential world states that are relative and adaptive to our waking life environment and the brain has sculpted itself to flow between the subset efficiently.

> The Consensus Reality Space occupies a (very large) set of states within the World Space, and your cortex has sculpted its connectivity such that it naturally moves through these states, which are those that comprise a functional model of the environment in normal waking life.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=105&annotation=JQ3E28FN))

##### Sculpting - Low vs high energy brain states in perception hypothesis

The brain tends towards low energy states, meaning low energy requirements for sustaining that state. These states are low energy because they are sculpted into efficiency neurally but also because they contain hypotheses and object representations that are less likely to error .

Perhaps, then, my inclination towards states of depression and collapse post concussions, and the challenge and struggle to get elsewhere in any significant way, represents the brain struggling to sustain the energy effort to sculpt/engage states that are unfamiliar after a year now and an injury, int he context of that injury resulting in generally lower energy capacity.

> Every low-energy state is essentially one that the cortex has “stored” by modifying its connectivity such that the state can eas- ily be accessed—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=107&annotation=MV73D9NM))

##### Ice Luge metaphor for high-low energy prediction hypothesis

Like the cool running ice luge, we send energy down established states, but if errors arise we being the energy back up the hill select a new hypothesis and send it down the track of that new hypothesis

##### Entering novel world spaces resulting from an alteration of what states are high and which are low

Entering into an entirely novel world state would mean altering our neural function such that it creates new low energy states for our World State to prioritize towards, while having consensus reality states becoming higher energy (and thus less prioritized)

> To reach and explore entirely separate regions of the World Space, the shape of the World Space Landscape must be distorted, lowering the energy of disfavoured states such that they become at- tractors, whilst raising the energy of the Consensus Reality Space states.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=113&annotation=MVSMAK7V))

### 7. The World Space Switches

....  

##### Neurotransmitter-neuromodulator Agonists vs antagonists

Agonists excite the neuron, antagonists either actively suppress the neuron from firing or do nothing, either way still occupying the receptor site and blocking agonists from docking

> antagonists — also bind to the receptor but, by virtue of their structure and charge distribution, either shift the receptor into a conformation state that does not interact with any signalling pathways, or have no effect at all on the receptor con- formation. Either way, the receptor isn’t shifted into an active state and the antagonist has no effect other than to block the binding of any agonists floating in the vicinity of the receptors—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 104](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=124&annotation=R27RTQAF))

....  

##### how psychedelic molecules effect receptor activity 

Psychedelics bind to various receptors and then alter their signalling function, and thus their fire/no fire behaviours. This changes how they communicate with each other, and thus alters the generation and flow of information, and thus the structure of the world models, which gives rise to the psychedelic effect. 

> When a psychedelic molecule binds and activates a receptor, it perturbs the intracellular signalling network and induces a new pattern of signalling activity, which changes the behaviour of the neuron. This change in behaviour at the level of single neurons alters the manner in which these neurons communicate. This perturbation of the flow of information between neurons affects the flow of information between cortical columns which, ultimately, alters the structure of the world model, experienced as the psychedelic effect. Different classes of psychedelic molecules activate particular receptor types on particular types of neurons, perturb the intracellular signalling network in their own particular manner, and have their own particular effect at the level of the world model—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 112-113](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=133&annotation=D7DV5TZC))

### 8. The C-Switch I (Level: Neuron) Cー ス イッ チ : 1
...  

##### World space switch definition 

The World Space Switch is the entire "multi-levelled mechanism" responsible for the alerting of the brain state dynamics that alter the world model, activated by a psychedelic molecule.

> A World Space Switch comprises not just the receptor that binds to the psychedelic molecule, but the entire multi-levelled mechanism responsible for the change in the structure and dynamics of the world model.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 130](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=150&annotation=GAQAMAHC))

##### The rigidness of LSD and other lysergimides is why they stay stuck in the binding site for longer than other tryptamines 

LSD, and other lysergimides, are different in their rigidness compared to other tryptamines. The consequence is that unlike more flexible tryptamines, which can be easily knocked out of place of the receptor site, once a lysergimides binds it stays bound for a long time.

> ore, once they’ve found their position in the binding site, rotation of a single bond can cause them to slip out again. Flexibility is a double-edged sword. Rigid molecules, in contrast, must possess the correct shape to fit into the binding site from the outset, otherwise the site will simply reject them. However, if the molecule is rigidified in the optimal orientation, the molecule will slip effortlessly into the correct position, rapidly establish the required interactions, and sit firmly in the binding si—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 142](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=162&annotation=26EY7US3))


....  
##### 5ht2a receptor will increase neuron firing when activated, however indirect suppression of glutamate is also important...

5ht2a receptor will increase neuron firing when activated. However, it is not just the selective activation of the 5ht2a receptors that produces psychedelic effects as there needs to be at least partial suppression of the mGluR2 glutamate receptor. This is because that receptor can suppress activation of the neuron, which is part of where the psychedelic effects come from.  
   
The classical psychedelics do not impact the mGluR2 directly, though

> This directly counter- acts the depolarising effect of the 5HT2A receptor to the extent that, for a molecule to be psychedelic, it must not only activate the 5HT2A receptor, but must also partially suppress the activa- tion of mGluR2 by glutamate (which is present whenever a neuron is being stimulated). However, unsurprisingly, none of the classic psychedelics are able to directly bind and affect the activation of the mGluR2 receptor. They achieve this mGluR2 suppression by inducing a unique interaction between the 5HT2A receptor and the mGluR2 receptor—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 152](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=172&annotation=YVVW2NVQ))

....  

##### the relationship between 5ht2a and mGluR2 receptors with respect to classical psychedelics

The 5ht2a and mGluR2 receptors form a kind of complex (they are related in their receptor) and the classical psychedelics distort the receptor protein that receives the mGluR2, making it so that the receptor can't activate the g-protien that would result in suppressing hyperpolarizaion (suppression of firing)

> The difference between psychedelic and non-psychedelic 5HT2A agonists lies in the way they modulate this interaction. When a classic psychedelic, such as LSD, binds the 5HT2A receptor, it induces a conformational change in the receptor protein that also distorts the mGluR2 receptor to which the receptor is complexed. This inhibits the mGluR2 receptor’s ability to activate the Gi protein and—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 153](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=173&annotation=F9I7DI6F))

....  

### 9\. The C-Switch II (Level: Network) Cー ス イッ チ : 2



> As discussed in the last chapter, 5HT2A activation by the classic psychedelics, coupled with mGluR2 receptor signalling suppression, increases the excitability of the pyramidal cells by sustained depolarisation and inhibition of slow afterhyperpolarisation.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 156](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=176&annotation=ZVNFMSJ9))

....  

##### how classical psychedelics effect high-order representations and hypothesis at the neural level

The sculpted connections between synapses, correlated with certain sets of high-order representations and their associated hypothesis, makes it such that certain subsets of potentials hypothesis and world-states are more likely with others blocked as those sculpted connections are more likely to fire/not fire accordance to those states.  

The classical psychedelics, however, through their alteration to the firing patterns of the 5th2a receptors, disrupt this process and the normally well-troughed pathways by which information is generated and processed is destabilized. Thus the typical stabilization of hypotheses is disrupted, and the brain can no longer achieve the brain states necessary for our normally well-defined world model.

> By selectively activating 5HT2A receptors and causing sustained depolarisation of the deep pyramidal cells across all the columns of the visual cortices responsible for constructing your visual world, the classic psych- edelics effectively override these finely-tuned connections, since even weak connections become able to transmit information be- tween columns. Whilst this might be a small effect between any particular pair of columns, the effect over the entire cortex is more dramatic: Columns become hyper-excitable, responding strongly to weak inputs and delivering flurries of signals to other hyper-ex- citable columns. Information begins to flow out of the normally well-demarcated networks and the structure of the world-model begins to break down. The cortex loses control of the information flowing from column to column, losing its ability to construct the stable and well-defined set of hypotheses that comprise the world model (2)—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 158](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=178&annotation=YG8AGMB3))

....  

The result is that the brain is able to leaves the normal confines of Consensus Reality Space and enter into brain states/worlds otherwise inaccessible. This is because the normal brain state has now become the "high energy state" and the brains flow of activation is encouraged to enter into other states that are now low-energy. It allows for a more random, and diverse repertoire of brain states (and thus world models) to be accessed.  

(there is a whole other layer of info here about alpha-beta oscillations and specific role of pyramidal cells that is beyond me in my reframing of this info)

> allows the brain to reach outside of the Consensus Reality Space into areas of the World Space unavailable in the absence of the psychedel- ic molecule. The states within the Consensus Reality Space are destabilised — their energy is raised — and the energies of states outside of it are lowered. This amounts to a flattening of the World Space Landscape, which the cortex can wander more freely. In functional neuroimaging studies, this is observed as an increase in the cortex’s “state repertoire” — the cortex adopts patterns of ac- tivity not seen in the normal waking state and is observed to move from state to state in a more random fashion (3)—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 160](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=180&annotation=IN85UH2J))

....  

##### Tryptamines alters which our brain's capacity to land on a strong hypotheses / filter sensory information

Thus strong hypothesis are no longer able to out compete weaker ones, which are now more likely to take hold. However, those weaker ones are less coordinated, and thus contribute to greater error signals and decreased capacity to effectively make predictions, further destabilizing its hypothesis coherence. The brain then also looses the ability to thus filter sensory information.

> So, rather than a set of strong and stable hypotheses extinguish- ing weaker rivals and delivering robust and synchronised predictions down the cortical hierarchy, the strong hypotheses are weakened and destabilised and the weaker ones are able to maintain themselves in the absence of well-coordinated inhibition. Model predictions become weaker and more disorganised and, naturally, error signals begin to accumulate (8). The cortex loses its ability to predict and thus filter sensory information, which begins to flow untrammelled (in the form of error signals) up the cortical hierarchy. So, overall, the brain loses control not only of the flow of information within itself but, also, into itself. Sensory information that would normally be perfectly predictable and successfully filtered out suddenly begins flowing into the cortex. In short, the cortex becomes much more sensitive to sensory inputs.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 163](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=183&annotation=UUHH2KTJ))

None of the new hypotheses generated will land either, though. There is no stability in prediction available while under the psychedelic effect. Objects of perception are without solid meaning.  

.....

> Despite its best effort, the disrupted model will continue to fail in generating accurate predictions and the prediction errors remain. This results in a fluid and unstable world model, as the cortex constantly modifies its model hypotheses in a repeatedly futile attempt at neutralising the elevated errors flowing unabated up the cortical hierarchy. The brain shifts from hypothesis to hypothesis in an often highly apparent and striking manner, as objects visibly morph and change their identity before the eyes. —([Gallimore, 2022, p. 165](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=185&annotation=SWDUVTT4))

This is similar for all classical psychedelics, but unique to each different drug as well. As each one effects the 5ht2a site slightly differently as well as has relationships with other receptor sites as well as the 5ht2a site, thus the cascading effect of those differently nuanced multi-receptor effects. Resulting in different phenomenological effects

....  
This decreased ability to filter sensory information means that under the effect of psychedelics we are actually "absorbing more information from the environment" ... although more information does not equate to greater comprehension by default.

> But, when a psychedelic is ingested and the filtering mechanism disrupted, the flower appears entirely new, novel, surprising, and imbued with significance. It’s tempting to dismiss this effect as some kind of illusory perception or distortion of reality. However, the removal of the brain’s filtering mechanism actually increases the amount of information absorbed and processed by the cortical hierarchy. When you ingest a psychedelic drug, you really are ab- sorbing more information from the environment—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 164](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=184&annotation=YN6J4TXV))

##### Classical psychedelics enter us into a neurobiologically childhood like state

Infancy through childhood is a time where the brain prunes away unnecessary connections and sculpts itself towards optimizing its predictive capacities, as well as prioritizing certain prediction of others (creating strong hypothesis/low energy states). 

When classical psychedelics dismantle those strong hypotheses and predictive capacities, they are putting us into a neurobiologically childlike state


> The process of neural development from birth to adulthood is one of honing the cortex’s filtering mechanism to discard all but the most important — that’s to say, predictable — information from the environment. As you grow and develop, your world becomes, quite literally, more and more predictable as your cortex perfects its predictive skills. By shaking up these abilities, psychedelics remove that filtering mechanism and return your world to a more childlike state, when all is new.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 164](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=184&annotation=YVQX4YIQ))

> Whilst, in normal waking life, the DMN and TPN are diametrically opposed — helping to maintain the experience of separation between the self and the environment — under the influence of the classic psychedelics, information begins to flow between these networks and their distinction begins to blur. This is experienced as a dosage-dependent dissolution of the sense of self — culminating at high doses in so-called “ego death” — and a loss of the distinction between oneself and the outside world (15). This is also described as a feeling of oceanic boundlessness — an overwhelming sense of merging, or becoming “one”, with the world or, indeed, the entirety of existence itself (16).—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 170](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=190&annotation=BCJSJCTV))

### 10\. The C-Switch III (Level: World Space) Cー ス イッ チ : 3

##### DMT and 5-MeO-DMT both switch world spaces completely

Whereas other classical psychedelics, for the most part, alter our perceptions of the consensus reality space we are already in, DMT and 5-MeO-DMT seem to enter us into an entirely different reality/world space, entirely (seemingly) disconnected from consensus reality

> Both DMT and its 5-MeO-DMT provide a highly specific receptor-level perturbation that causes the World Space Landscape to move beyond the transitional flattening and ‘collapse’ into an entirely new structure in which the attractor states are located in an area of the World Space completely disjoint from those of the Consensus Reality Space.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 180](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=200&annotation=CPZAGRSW))

....  
##### Gallimore's take on the world-building mechanisms and world-replacing experince of DMT and 5MeODMT from predictive coding perspective

Their effect flattens the world space so completely as to create chaos and out of that chaos an entirely new world structure emerges

> DMT and 5-MeO-DMT both provide a robust and highly specific neuron-level perturbation that causes the World Space Landscape to collapse into a new, temporarily stable, structure in which the attractor states are completely separate from those of the Consensus Reality Space, forming the DMT and 5-Meo-DMT Spaces. In the case of DMT, this proceeds through distinct phases: firstly, the world begins to break down as the complex geometric forms at first veneer the world and then replace it entirely as the visions become increasingly wild and chaotic. Then a new world emerges from this chaos. Overall, there is a progression from order (the normal waking world) to disorder (the pre-breakthrough imagery) to a new order (the DMT worlds). This procession corresponds to the cortex’s attractor landscape firstly being heavily disrupted and then collapsing into the new geometry, which only occurs if the dose is sufficient and “breakthrough” is achieved. The experience of the DMT worlds is the cortex gliding through the valleys of this dramatically restructured World Space Landscape within the DMT Space. 5-MeO-DMT delivers a distinct but equally powerful perturbation of the cortex and, again in a dose-dependent manner, results in its own particular restructuring of the landscape experienced as the formless 5-MeO-DMT worlds represented by states within the 5-MeO-DMT Space.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 182](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=202&annotation=SUN4E4TN))

### 11\. The M-Switch Mー ス イッ チ

....  
^^^ Tropane alkaloids -- m1 receptor -- acetylcholine

##### Generating adaptive hypothesis - internally generated models - excessive environmental noise - invalid prediction errors - sensory gain modulation

Although a successful hypothesis is one that adaptively affirms the environment, this is dependant on the sensory information one is receiving from the environment is correct. This is not always the case and thus the brain must also be discerning in what signals it accepts and at times will trust the model more than the signal, such as in the case of a more word.

> your brain only ever has access to the environment via the patterns of sensory information it receives, so this information has a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the world model. On the other hand, it’s important that your brain doesn’t trust all sensory information without question, and it must learn to detect when it might be misleading—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=215&annotation=6A6KRGVZ))

....  
Essentially, it will at times find itself with what amounts noise (and thus excessive prediction errors) from environment without enough signal to reliably trust that it is getting (the errors are not resolvable) and it will thus infer/project signal from/onto that noise from it's model. The brain learns to trust its capacity to do so in times of excess noise, wherein the more noise the more it relies on its "internally-generated model".  

It only does this when it determines that the prediction errors are invalid as the environment is too noisy to rely on those errors being valid representations of an incorrect hypothesis.

> prediction errors resulting from low quality sensory information and random noise isn’t good evidence. By learning how much of this noise-generated prediction error is to be expected under different conditions (low light, fog, etc), your brain can assess whether a particular pattern of prediction error is likely to be newsworthy and indicative of important unpredicted changes in sensory information or, conversely, if it can safely be ignored.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 216](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=216&annotation=Q559FNKU))

Tropane alkaloids disrupt that gain modulation .

....  


##### Acetylcholine and M1 receptor role in neurological gain -environmental information's ability to influence hypothesis validity

Cholinergic receptors are also linked with the world-building process--superficial pyramidal cells--in that, when the brain trusts that the sensory information coming in is trustworthy, acetylcholine is released, activating excitability and increasing their responsiveness to predictions errors.  
If, however, the brain deems the environmental signals as untrustworthy, acetylcholine is not released and those neurons become less excitable, and thus prediction errors are no longer prioritized.

> if the brain trusts the sensory information arriving from the environment, acetylcholine is released and activates M1 receptors on these post-synaptic neurons, increasing their excitability and elevating their response to the incoming error signals (22). If, on the other hand, the sensory information is believed to be unreliable (under low-light conditions, for example), acetylcholine release is reduced and the input layer neurons become less excitable — errors signals are effectively dampened (23)—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 223](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=223&annotation=GYKKLBVQ))

**M1 activation on GABA-releasing inhibitory** interneurons by the presence of acetylcholine, helps to keep excessive background pyramidal activity slowed down, helping to maintain a coherent world model.

> activating M1 receptors on inhibitory interneurons, acetylcholine increases their activity and helps to keep background activity of pyramidal cells at a low level, which is important for maintaining a stable and coherent world model (25). By stimulating M1 receptors on both excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, acetylcholine reduces any noisy background activity whilst, at the same time, increasing the response to actual input from the environment.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 225](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=225&annotation=FRUGTEP7))


##### The neurological effect of tropane alkaloids on cholinergic-M1 activity and environmental modeling 

Tropane alkaloids compete for for m1 binding site, although they are 10000 strongly at binding. So it is a for sure win on their end.  

Thus the pyramidal and GABA neurons that might be stimulated by acetylcholine cannot be. Acetylcholine can no longer have its effect on the brain gain modulation mechanisms.  

The consequence is that the brain becomes excessively confident in its internally- generated model and hypothesis and extremely dismissive/distrusting of the reliability of environmental signal. They world-model, and the hypothesis that constitute it, become detached from the environment, no longer bound by the normal sensory assessment and error-checking rigor of the baseline brain.

> When a tropane alkaloid finds its way into the brain, it competes with acetylcholine for the M1 receptor binding site. However, the tropanes bind to the M1 receptor around 10,000 times more strongly than acetylcholine,—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 225](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=225&annotation=YZHH8NU5))

....  
##### The Difference in the effect of Classical Psychedelics and Tropane Alkaloids on the brain's world building neural mechanisms

Classical's decrease our capacity to hold a strong hypothesis while increasing our exposure to sensory information from our environment (through the decreasing of our brain's ability to filter out that sensory information).

Tropane alkaloids trick the brain into distrusting sensory information and lead it to build a world model that is internally-generated based on very little sensory information. It does so by making error signals no longer registered as valid, leading to a world model that is no longer in reference to or bound by sensory information.

> The classic psychedelics strongly disrupt the world model by selective stimulation of deep pyramidal cells. The flow of information — the error signals — up the cortical hierarchy, however, isn’t stymied. In fact, as we discussed in the chapters on the C-Switch, error signals actually increase in response to this model perturbation. In contrast, the tropanes’ major effect is in reducing the upwards flow of information and preventing the world model from being held to account by those error signals. This alone allows hypotheses with little sensory evidence to become established in the world model (27)—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 227](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=227&annotation=REXP65AJ))

....  
##### VISONS-difference between Classical and Tropane psychedelics  

Classic = destabilization of world model, with presence of error signals. Visions are unstable and fleeting, and clearly a deviation from our baseline sense of the world.  

Tropane = detachment of world model from environment with decreased error signals. Vision are stable, and seemingly no distinction between their stability and the stability of the baseline world as we generally know it

> The visions induced by the classic psychedelics also tend to be unstable, since the elevated errors signals force frequent updates to the world model (the hypothesis shifting effect). Since these error signals are muted by the tropanes, the visions tend to be more stable and often indistinguishable from the entirely adaptive remainder of the world.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 229](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=229&annotation=TXIW7PWR))

....  
##### Although the tropane experince is very much like a dream, it lacks dreaming's from protection from physically responding to the dream.

> Unlike dreaming, however, in which the dreamer’s motor function is mercifully inhibited to save them acting out their dreams, there is no such mercy for the tropane tripper, who will often begin interacting with the non-existent people and objects in their own private fantasy world.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 231](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=231&annotation=QR286VVK))

....  
##### Trip sitting a Tropane Journey

> To an outside observer — a trip sitter is obviously recommended for such voyages — the tripper’s behaviour will often appear frighteningly bizarre, and it’s often at this point that medical assistance is sought. Unfortunately, the motives and intent of anyone attempting to assist the tripper will likely be entirely unappreciated, and attempts at encouraging or coercing them tend to be met with resistance or, in some cases, outright violence.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 231](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=231&annotation=D3YWB6CY))


### 12\. The N-Switch Nー ス イッ チ

**Ketamine and other PCP like drugs, activate the NMDA receptor** 

##### Magnesium blocks the firing of NDMA firing while it sits in the NDMA site, but enough AMPA activity (error signals) will knock out the Mg and cause NMDA to Fire

...

##### Pyramidal cells use glutamate to send signals as a part of their world-model predictions process-slow NMDA receptor for downward flowing predictions, quick AMPA receptor for upward flowing error signals 
....  
The feedback process of the world-model predictions in the pyramidal cells uses glutamate to send signals.  

The downward feedback of the world models predictions is mediated by NMDA as its long-lasting action is appropriate due to the world-model being largely stable over longer periods of time.  

The upward-flowing feedback of errors signals uses the AMPA receptors as their short lasting (and thus faster) action is vital to deliver errors signals up the cortical highway quickly enough to allow for a build of of errors triggering a alteration of predictions.  

Whereas the quick capacity of AMPA allows for easy error signals as appropriate, the long capacity to NMDA allows for a stable prediction/hypothesis to be maintained until sufficient accumulation of errors.  

Those errors, lots of AMPA, eventually kicks the Mg (blocks firing) out of the NMDA and triggers it to fire.

> the long-lasting NMDA signalling is more suitable for the downward-flowing feedback connections, since the high-level model and its predictions are likely to remain largely unchanged over longer periods of time. This is because the updating of the model and its predictions entails the accumulation of prediction errors over time, so predictions change more slowly than error signals—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 242](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=242&annotation=TIPR8D4J))

....  
##### Neural oscillations and synchronized patterns of brain activation

There is a whole layer of info here about how neural oscillations interlink and coordinate the functioning of the various columns and structures of the brain with each other and itself that I have just not made note of due to it feeling like it was a layer deeper than I was able to hold while reading... although I am apparently holding a kind of memory of it at the very top level

> A single neuron might receive thousands of connections from other neurons that generate EPSPs via NMDA receptors, and a constant low level activation of NMDA receptors in pyramidal cells is essential for maintaining the alpha-beta oscillations that are crucial in synchronising the activity of large groups of columns across the cortex—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 242](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=242&annotation=TW6FVWFF))

....  

> Strong hypotheses tend to be built from highly synchronised patterns of column activation that recruit inhibitory interneurons to extinguish weaker hypotheses built from poorly synchronised columns.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 243](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=243&annotation=VRTTMAKS))

##### NMDA receptors associated with ketamine effects of world model are located in three places.
  
-   Dendrites in the superficial layers of cortical columns
-   Deep pyramidal cells 
-   Inhibitory interneurons between deep pyramidal cells

pg. 220


##### Ketamine vs Tropane Alkaloids effect on neuron binding sites and conformational proteins 


> unlike the tropane alkaloids, which compete for the M1 receptor ligand binding site with acetylcholine, both ketamine and PCP are non-competitive antagonists, meaning they bind to the receptor at a location separate from the ligand (glutamate) binding site. Once bound, they cause a change in the receptor conformation that blocks the flow of ions through the channel whether or not glutamate is bound — the receptor ceases to function as a gated channel—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 243](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=243&annotation=JHW87N6T))

....  

##### Ketamine disinhibits cortical stimulation by blocking GABA action in the inhibitory interneurons of superficial neurons and deep pyramidal cells (blocks capacity to hold strong hypothesis)

Ketamine prevents inhibition of cortical stimulation as it blocks the capacity of GABA to provide that inhibition. And that inhibition is recruited by various columns to sustain their stability and reduce the likelihood of other, more random columns from activating... meaning that GABA helps sustain strong hypothesis while suppressing weaker ones.  

This increased cortical activation, then, makes it more difficult for normal hypothesis to win out over competing ones. (this happens both in the deep but also the superficial layers of the cortical columns)

Similar to classical psychedelics, but without activation of the deep pyramidal cells, there isn't the increased firing that allows for visionary elements at lower doses such as the classical allow for.

> Since these interneurons are also responsible for sculpting the pattern of column activation, competition between columns is reduced and active columns can more easily activate other columns — activity tends to spread more freely across the cortex and it becomes more difficult for particular hypotheses to win out over competing ones. This is somewhat comparable to the effect of the classic psychedelics, although since ketamine doesn’t directly activate the deep pyramidal cells, at low doses, visions and hallucinations are less common—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 224](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=244&annotation=MYV9XG3Y))

....  

##### Ketamine's blocking of inhibitory interneurons of the deep pyramidal cells creates and unstable meaning landscape

This also means that the meaning of things (the hypothesis) is cleared and objects are not longer what they once were compared to other objects, nor are they able to hold a particular meaning due to the inability of hypotheses to win out against competing ones.  

> When given ketamine in an experimental setting, people struggle to distinguish between different objects presented to them (19), since their world model is unable to provide the precise predictions necessary to differentiate objects with visual similarities. This is similar to the kind of object-blending that occurs with the classic psychedelics — the cortex is unable to settle on a hypothesis and objects in the world shift and switch their identity:—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 245](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=245&annotation=2SQ5G52P))



##### Lower doses of ketamine enhance sensory input -- block top-down world model hypothesis stability (NMDA), while continuing to allow bottom-up (AMPA) signals from environment  - 

The blocking of NMDA and not AMPA means that the top-down world model is unable to be sustained, but the bottom-up sensory data (and error signals) continue unabated. Like classical psychedelics, this increased ones susceptibility to environmental signals, without a top-down constrains on how they are experienced. enhanced sensory experience.  
(lower doses)

> also block the NMDA receptors on the superficial layer dendrites receiving the top-down predictions from the model. However, since there is no disruption of bottom-up processing, the flow of sensory information (error signals) continues unabated (21). The balance between trusting the world model and trusting sensory information is tipped towards the latter — this is the opposite of the tropane alkaloids, which allow the world model to remain uncontested despite becoming more and more divorced from the environment.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 245](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=245&annotation=A57HE362))


....  
##### At higher doses ketamine also blocks sensory input but blocking the firing of deep pyramidal cells -- anesthesia 

At lower doses, ketamine has the sensory enhancing effects described above. 

However, at higher doses the drug goes beyond inhibitory interneurons and begins to bind to the NMDA receptors of the deep pyramidal cells and the effects of the low dose are reversed, the bottom-up signals get blocked, which is where the anesthetic effects come in.

> e. Since NMDA receptors are excitatory, their widespread blockade begins to suppress pyramidal cell firing — a complete inversion of the effects at low doses—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 251](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=251&annotation=YTKZPLEK))

....  
##### Ketamine has two distinct "dose-dependant effect plateaus" which alternate back and for at higher doses -- state of alternating is the k-hole

> Ketamine, in particular, displays two distinct dose-dependent effect plateaus.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 250](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=250&annotation=FDKEI6RU))

Whereas lower doses increase complexity and thus lead towards subtle psychedelic effects, higher doses create a back-and-forth alternating between high complexity and low complexity (no awareness like normal anesthetics).  

Essentially, wavering between unconsciousness (where little is remembered) and psychedelic consciousness (where novel worlds are experienced).  
This deep state is the k hole and can be undesirable if unintended.  

The peak psychedelic effects of ketamine emerge when the dose level begins to tapper off out of the anesthetic level back down through the psychedelic level and into baseline. That window between anesthesia and low-dose psychedelics presents a kind of psychedelic-type experiences of what seems to be entirely other worlds.

> cortical activity alternates between periods of high complexity and anaesthesia-associated low complexity before returning to the psychedelic high complexity state during recovery. The user’s (or patient’s) consciousness rapidly switches between full awareness and an unconscious state disconnected from the environment — a fragmented dream-like state unlike that elicited by any other class of psychedelic molecule.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=253&annotation=VFIDBNZ5))

....  

The alternating between low-complexity and high complexity... "hopping" between psychedelic worlds and unconsciousness. This is different than most world space explorations with psychedelics and/or dreaming as the states do not slide into and out of each other, but hop between world/no-world

> Under conditions when the cortex is constructing a phenomenal world — the normal waking state, the REM dream state, and the classic psychedelic state, for example — the cortex normally tends to glide across the World Space Landscape smoothly from state to state. However, the highdose ketamine-induced trajectory is starkly different and appears to be more of a ‘hopping’ across the Landscape — the cortex moves across the World Space Landscape only intermittently, before hopping off the Landscape into the no-World Space before, a few seconds later, landing back on the Landscape.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 254](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=254&annotation=ZDE2AH8M))

##### Very high but sub-anesthetic doses create pure awareness states similar to 5-MeO-DMT

> Very high doses often propel the user into a formless state of pure awareness in an infinite space field, not entirely dissimilar to the state induced by 5-MeO-DMT. However, again, the experiences remain distinct.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=253&annotation=JE7C7NLD))

##### Saliva's psychedelic compounds are terpenes, not alkaloids

Whereas all other natural occurring psychedelic compounds are alkaloids, those in salvia are terpenes.

> All the known naturally-occurring psychedelics, prior to the discovery of salvinorin-A, were nitrogen-containing alkaloids. Salvinorin-A — the first of ten closely-related salvinorins (A-J) to be isolated from the Salvia divinorum plant — belongs to an entirely different class of natural molecules: the terpenes—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 259](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=259&annotation=7XS5ZVVB))



....  
##### A world model remaining coherent, meaningful, and useful means it needs to remain solid enough to constrain to a certain subset of states, but flexible enough to slide between them 

Although each state is different than the last—as different objects of awareness take more or less center stage and hypothesis are offered, error-checked, and altered or renewed—the world model must be well constructed and constrained to functional subset of states so as to also be flexible but contained enough to effectively be able to slide from state to state within itself. These are essential elements of world model being coherent, meaningful, and useful.

> For this world model to be coherent, meaningful and, above all, useful, each state must not only be properly constructed but must also give way to the next state there must be an orderly transition of power from state to state.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 261](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=261&annotation=NVSR32DY))

....  

##### The function of the claustrum with respect to maintaining a coherent set of world space states

> The claustrum is a relatively small sheet of highly interconnected neurons sitting beneath the cortex and connected with almost all of its areas (8). The claustrum’s major function is as a regulator and orchestrator of cortical activity. The control over cortical activity maintained by the claustrum is one of general inhibition and selective amplification (pg. 242)

The claustrum is interlinked with primary cortical cells and operates as a kind of station where these cells can send signals, which are received and sent back inhibited.  

However, both excite and inhibit inputs are received, and there is a time delay wherein enough excitation in a short enough time window can elicit an activation response back to the cortex before inhibition.  

Meaning that although all states have a moment of potential activations, highly synchronized states come to the claustrum in that time window will thus continue on into activation before being eventually inhibited, whereas more random states will be extinguished before they get the chance.  

This allows for all manner of potential states to be assessed, and for highly synchronized states (sculpted world space states) to be prioritized over others, but to still be extinguished in other for the next wave of states to activate.  
Allowing for a regulated shifting from state within the constrained of the sculpted world space subset of states that accord to baseline reality.

> A pattern of synchronised column activity can stimulate the claustral principal neurons almost simultaneously and, before the delayed inhibition extinguishes it, implant their pattern of activity in the claustrum. Using the dense network of inhibitory interneurons, this rapidly establishes a pattern of highly synchronised and structured activity within the claustral principal neurons, which then output back to the cortex, amplifying and reinforcing the synchronised column activity. Poorly synchronised or noisy column activity will fail to generate synchronised activity in the claustrum and will receive weaker and poorly synchronised inputs in return that suppresses their activity via the feedforward inhibitory circuit. Of course, even the amplified columns will receive a wave of inhibition after a delay, which terminates their activity, making way for new patterns to establish themselves. Overall, this allows the cortex to move from state to state in a regulated sequential manner, with each state breifly amplified and then terminated.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 267](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=267&annotation=UXG3K9LV))

....  

##### Whereas the thalamus is like a relay station, the claustrum is like a conductor of an orchestra.

> In a manner analogous to the conductor of an orchestra, who must control when each set of instruments should sound and when they should again be quiet, the claustrum orchestrates the activity of the cortex by amplifying patterns of column activation representing the world model, quieting noisy activity, and guiding the cortex smoothly from state to state.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 270](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=270&annotation=HFLDRNIR))

....  

##### Salvinorin inhibits claustrum function 

Salvinorin inhibits claustrum function  and thus prevents our normal subset of world states to activate with priority, as well as prevents the states that do activate from doing so in a way that is a smooth sliding transition.

> By activating kappa opioid receptors on the claustral principal cells, salvinorin A strongly inhibits the claustrum and deactivates the claustro-cortical connections that act as the inhibitory “orchestrator” of the cortex—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 272](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=272&annotation=ABMIF3NC))

> Overall, the cortex loses control over its activity and the flow from state to state. This might be compared to instructing an orchestra to play a complex symphony faster and faster and then shooting the conductor. It is hardly surprising then that salvinorin has such "reality tearing" properties as described first by Siebert.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 273](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=273&annotation=4M58VPVC))

....  

##### Salvinorin vs classical psychedelics effect on neural functioning

> Whereas the classic psychedelics provide an excitatory perturbation, nudging pyramidal cells closer to their firing threshold, salvinorin employs a release mechanism, disengaging the apparatus that normally keeps cortical activity under control.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 278](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=278&annotation=NTAE8USS))



### 14\. Engineering Reality


Near the end of the book you speak about the vast and exciting potential of highly selective design of psychedelic molecules to explore specific world spaces... I agree, although I wonder about that urge in the context of not slowing down to embrace and learn the intelligence of nature due to the bigger and better next-ness of humanity that has left in such a complicated mess ATM. Racing after the next newest most optimized technology before taking time to consider and deepen into learning from the consequences of the most previous.  
finding new drugs vs leaning from the plants. This is not an accusation, but a genuine inquiry.

> Eventually, it will become possible not only to design a molecule to selectively bind and activate a particular receptor, but also to control the conformational change induced by the molecule and thus the interactions with the intracellular signalling pathways. This will be the next step in the design of molecules to elicit a specific type of psychedelic effect or to access particular areas of the World Space Landscape. Whilst all the classic psychedelics act via the 5HT2A receptor, each perturbs the intracellular signalling pathway in its own unique way, albeit currently with little control.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 284](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=284&annotation=GNAPHSDD))

....  
##### Exploring what would be theoretically necessary for someone to be in a controlled extended DMT trip, including catheters and feeding tubes..... wild.

> Since there is no theoretical limit on the duration of the expeditions using this extended-state technology, World Space Explorers could remain within the DMT Space for as long as is necessary to gather and communicate detailed and sophisticated information, to perform experiments, and to establish and maintain communication with any contacted intelligent entities. In fact, extended sojourns lasting months or longer aren’t completely out of the question. However, naturally, the amount of preparation required (and potential risks) will increase with the length of the expedition. Once journeys beyond a single day are undertaken, meeting the nutritive requirements of the human body, and the removal of waste, will need to be taken care of. Fortunately, intravenous feeding systems and apparatus for the collection of urinary and faecal waste are already well-developed for medical settings, and their incorporation as part of a unified extended-state journeying system is likely to be relatively straight forward. However, aside from these basic physiological needs, the nuerological and psychological impacts of longer expediations must be carefully considered.—([Gallimore, 2022, p. 292](zotero://select/library/items/DU8JIXUQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FAH3R9X?page=292&annotation=AB7CP4QE))

## World Switches Summary

### Classical - C

-   Activating the serotonin 5HT2A receptor causing it to be more likely to fire (increasing excitability), while indirectly influencing the glutamate mGlu2 receptor causing that receptor to be unable to suppress the firing of 5HT2A
-   Classical's decrease our capacity to hold a strong hypothesis, making weaker hypotheses possible not still unstable.
-   They also increase our exposure to sensory information from our environment and from within through the decreasing of our brain's ability to filter out that sensory information.

### Tropane - M switch

-   Whereby acetylecholine binding to M1 receptors on both cholinergic pyramidal neurons that trigger attention to environmental signals as valid data for the world model, as well as GABA neurons which results in a decrease of environmental noise.
-   Tropane alkaloids bind to the cholinergic M1 receptor, blocking acetylcholine from binding there. This effectively causes theGABA neurons to be unable to filter noise, while also preventing the pyramidal cells from firing (trusting the validity of environmental signals and prediction errors) and thus leading the brain to distrust sensory information environment from the environment, to disregard error signals as being invalid.
        -   The brain then compensates for this distrust by relying more heavily on an internally- generated model. This means that the hypothesis on which it is building the world model are experiences as being indistinguishable from our normal baseline sense of the world (in the sense that hypothesis are strong and determined as reliable) but are no longer tether to environmental signals. We enter into a kind of waking dream.
 -   Tropane alkaloids trick the brain into distrusting sensory information and lead it to build a world model that is internally-generated based on very little sensory information. It does so by making error signals no longer registered as valid, leading to a world model that is no longer in reference to or bound by sensory information.

### Ketamine/PCP - N switch
   
-   Pyramidal cells use glutamate to send signals as a part of their world-model predictions process
        -   slow NMDA receptor for downward flowing predictions
        -   quick AMPA receptor for upward flowing error signals
        -   Whereas the quick capacity of AMPA allows for easy error signals as appropriate, the long capacity to NMDA allows for a stable prediction/hypothesis to be maintained until sufficient accumulation of errors.  
        -   Magnesiums sits in the NMDA channel clocking firing, enough AMPA knocks it out to trigger firing
 -   NMDA receptors associated with ketamine effects of world model are located in three palces.
        -   Dendrites in the superficial layers of cortical columns
            -   blocks inhibition of NMDA withAMPA is unaffected leading to increased sensory input
            -   This is primary with low dose
        -   Deep pyramidal cells
            -   Blocks the firing of these cells, meaning it now also blocks bottom up environmental and sensory signals
            -   Produces anesthesia
            -   This is higher doses
        -   Inhibitory interneurons between deep pyramidal cells
            -   blocks inhibition of NMDA, leading to unstable top-down hypotheses
            -   Meaning of things is destabilized
 -   Ketamine has two effect plataeus which are dose dependant
        -   low - increased sensory input and decreased hypothesis strength producing mild psychedelics effects (high complexity states)
        -   high - Blocking of all sensory input producing unconsciousness (low complexity states)
 -   K-Holes are an alternating between the two plateaus
        -   Essentially, wavering between unconsciousness (where little is remembered) and psychedelic consciousness (where novel worlds are experienced).  
        -   The alternating between low-complexity and high complexity... "hopping" between psychedelic worlds and unconsciousness. This is different than most world space explorations with psychedelics and/or dreaming as the states do not slide into and out of each other, but hop between world/no-world


### Salvia - k switch

-   Salvinorin A (-j) is a terpene not an alkaloid
    -   is a Kappa Opioid receptors agonist
    -   Salvinorin activates the kappa receptors in the principle cells of the claustrum
-   The claustrum is a regulator of cortical activity, the orchestra conductor of cortical activity
        -   it helps facilities a coherent world model by constraining cortical states to a defined subset
            -   It _allows highly synchronized states as they can withstand the inhibitory effects of the claustrum long enough continue onto activation_, while _preventing less synchronized states from continuing_ as they are squashed by that inhibitory potential before they can continue on.
            -   While also _ensuring the smooth transition between those constrained subsets_ of states by ensuring that all states eventually get inhibited allowing for other states to take over
        -   This allows for all manner of potential states to be assessed, and for highly synchronized states (sculpted world space states) to be prioritized over others, but to still be extinguished in other for the next wave of states to activate.
        -   Allowing for a regulated shifting from state within the constrained of the sculpted world space subset of states that accord to baseline reality.
-   Salvinorin inhibits claustrum function and thus prevents our normal subset of world states to activate with priority, as well as prevents the states that do activate (which are now effectively randomized) from doing so in a way that is a smooth sliding transition.
