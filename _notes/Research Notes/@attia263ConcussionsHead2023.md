## Personal Summary

>[!...]
> This was a podcast interview between Dr. Peter Attia and one of the world's leading researchers on concussion, Mickey Collins PhD. It covered mostly basics of the condition and treatment, without any explicit focus on any explicit treatments. It was helpful and interesting, though.

## Notes

#### The 6 Types of Concussion

- Cognitive
- Vestibular
- Ocular
- Migraine
- Anxiety
- Neck

Someone can have multiple types, and there are symptom overlap, but they need to be identified correctly so they targeted specifically. Without that specific targeting, there is unlikely to be effective resolution of symptoms.

Thus, you want to go to someone who knows what they are doing.


#### No cell death, energy crisis

Concussion is not the death of cells, but the stretching of their membranes.

This results in an energy crisis.


#### NO biomarkers for concussion

There are no biomarkers that can effectively identity concussion.  
Not CAT, MRI, PET, etc.

>[! warning] However...
>This is at odd with what I understand about a new blood test, as well as SPECT scans as being able to show concussion.

#### Pre-existing risk factors can increase likelihood of concussion, and type

for example, anxiety and eyesight issues are both pre-existing risk factors

#### Donâ€™t play though it, early treatment is essential

Despite me having worked through it due to necessity, this is not a good call.

Lack of early treatment will present complications and even serious issues with treatment over the long term.
