## ## The Fundamental Impoverishment Of The Naturalism Worldview

Created: 2022-12-05

> It’s here where I come up against some unexamined assumptions in the naturist’s conceptualization of “reality” that highlight the fundamental impoverishment of this worldview. Naturism posits that the natural world consists only of what is external, what can be measured by science. In doing so, it dismisses entire realms of experience that are internal, that cannot (at least at the present time) be measured by any scientific instrumentation available to us, but that nonetheless are “real” in the sense that we experience them.—([“How psychedelics can help save the world: visionary and indigenous voices speak out”, 2022, p. 111](zotero://select/library/items/4JWT9MM7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMMUBHQL?page=129&annotation=HGM7J75N))
